    "summary_full": "This prospective longitudinal study investigated the effects of 6 months of microgravity exposure on the International Space Station (ISS) on the lumbar spine anatomy, health, and biomechanics of six astronauts. Using MRI and dynamic fluoroscopy before and after spaceflight, researchers measured lumbar lordosis, intervertebral disc water content, vertebral end plate pathology, and muscle cross-sectional areas (CSA) and functional cross-sectional areas (FCSA) of the multifidus and erector spinae muscles. Results showed a significant decrease in supine lumbar lordosis and active flexion-extension range of motion (FE ROM) in the middle lumbar discs. Multifidus muscle atrophy (decreased FCSA and CSA) was observed in most subjects and strongly correlated with the loss of lordosis and decreased active FE ROM. Notably, disc water content did not change significantly. Only astronauts with pre-existing end plate irregularities experienced post-flight lumbar symptoms, such as chronic low back pain or disc herniation. The study concludes that multifidus atrophy, rather than disc swelling, is a key factor in lumbar flattening and increased stiffness post-spaceflight, potentially increasing injury risk upon return to gravity. These findings have implications for both astronaut countermeasures and understanding chronic low back pain on Earth.",

    "conclusions": "Prolonged microgravity exposure leads to multifidus muscle atrophy, which is strongly associated with lumbar spine flattening and increased stiffness. These changes, particularly when combined with pre-existing vertebral end plate insufficiency, may elevate the risk of lumbar injury upon return to Earth's gravity. The findings suggest that interventions targeting the multifidus muscles are crucial for maintaining astronaut spine health and may also benefit individuals with chronic low back pain on Earth.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals that multifidus muscle atrophy, not disc swelling, is the primary cause of lumbar spine instability after spaceflight, offering critical insights for developing astronaut countermeasures and understanding terrestrial low back pain."
