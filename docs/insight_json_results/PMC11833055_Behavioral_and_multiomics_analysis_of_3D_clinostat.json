    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of simulated microgravity using a 3D clinostat on mice, focusing on the central nervous system. Mice exposed to the 3D clinostat showed decreased activity, altered gait, and enhanced fear memory, alongside bone loss and changes in brain transcriptome, serum metabolomics, and gut microbiota. The 3D clinostat model demonstrated a closer resemblance to spaceflight-induced transcriptome changes compared to the hindlimb unloading model, suggesting its utility in studying microgravity-related neurological alterations and highlighting the need to consider emotional changes during space travel.",
