    "summary_full": "This study investigated whether housing male mice at thermoneutral temperatures (32°C) could prevent the premature loss of cancellous bone observed in mice housed at standard room temperature (22°C). The researchers found that male C57BL/6J mice housed at 32°C from 5 to 16 weeks of age maintained cancellous bone volume in the femur and lumbar vertebrae, whereas those housed at 22°C showed significant reductions. Thermoneutral housing was associated with increased bone formation (higher osteocalcin, increased osteoblast activity) and decreased bone resorption (lower CTX-1). While thermoneutral housing led to increased abdominal white adipose tissue and serum leptin, it did not affect bone marrow adiposity. The magnitude of bone loss in males was comparable to that previously observed in females, suggesting that housing temperature is a critical, sex-independent variable in mouse models of bone aging.",

    "conclusions": "Housing male C57BL/6J mice at thermoneutral temperature (32°C) from 5 to 16 weeks of age prevents the premature cancellous bone loss observed at standard room temperature (22°C). This protective effect is mediated by increased bone formation and decreased bone resorption, and is similar in magnitude between sexes. Housing temperature is a critical experimental variable that significantly impacts bone metabolism in mice.",
    "impact_statement": "This study identifies housing temperature as a crucial, often overlooked, factor influencing bone metabolism in mouse models, with implications for the translation of research findings to human bone health."
