    "summary_full": "This study developed and validated a novel three-dimensional (3-D) co-culture model of human intestinal epithelial cells (HT-29) and macrophages (U937) using a NASA Rotating Wall Vessel bioreactor. The model mimics in vivo intestinal microenvironments, exhibiting structural and functional characteristics like apical-basolateral polarity, tight junctions, and functional macrophages. The model was used to study the colonization patterns of different Salmonella enterica pathovars (Typhimurium strains SL1344 and D23580, and Typhi strain Ty2) under aerobic and microaerobic conditions. Results showed that the presence of macrophages significantly decreased Salmonella colonization compared to an epithelial-only model, indicating antimicrobial function. Pathovar-specific differences in adherence, invasion, and intracellular survival were observed, with D23580 showing enhanced replication/survival. The study highlights the importance of host multicellular complexity and environmental factors like oxygen availability in regulating Salmonella infection.",

    "conclusions": "The developed 3-D co-culture model of intestinal epithelium and macrophages represents a significant advancement for studying enteric diseases. It recapitulates key in vivo features and allows for the assessment of synergistic contributions of different cell types during infection. The model successfully differentiated Salmonella pathovar colonization patterns influenced by host multicellular complexity and oxygen availability, providing a more physiologically relevant context for understanding host-pathogen interactions and identifying potential therapeutic targets.",
