    "summary_full": "This study investigates the mechanisms of gravitropism in woody stems of Populus, focusing on tension wood formation. The research identifies specialized cells in the stem containing amyloplasts and expressing the PIN3 auxin transporter as key for gravity perception. Gravistimulation leads to PIN3 relocalization, directing auxin transport towards the cambium on the upper (tension wood) side and away from it on the lower (opposite wood) side, triggering differential growth. Gibberellic acid (GA) treatment enhances tension wood formation and gravibending, and potentiates auxin response. The transcription factor ARBORKNOX2 (ARK2) plays a crucial role, with its expression levels influencing fiber development, maturation rate, and overall gravibending performance. High ARK2 levels correlate with faster fiber maturation and enhanced gravibending, while low ARK2 levels lead to more fibers but delayed maturation and reduced bending. Transcriptome analysis revealed complex regulatory networks involving ARK2, GA, and auxin in wood formation, suggesting ARK2 integrates multiple developmental processes rather than acting as a master regulator. The study proposes a model where initial gravity perception and auxin redistribution, modulated by GA and ARK2, orchestrate the formation of tension wood and opposite wood, leading to negative gravitropism in woody stems.",

    "conclusions": "Gravitropism in woody Populus stems is a complex process involving gravity perception in specialized cells, auxin redistribution mediated by PIN3, and the coordinated action of auxin, gibberellic acid, and the ARK2 transcription factor. ARK2 integrates hormonal signaling and cell wall development pathways, influencing fiber maturation and ultimately the stem's ability to achieve negative gravitropism. The study highlights the intricate transcriptional networks governing wood formation and suggests that opposite wood plays a more active role in gravitropism than previously recognized.",
