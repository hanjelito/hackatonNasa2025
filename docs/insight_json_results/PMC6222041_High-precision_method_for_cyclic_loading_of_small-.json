    "document_title": "High-precision method for cyclic loading of small-animal vertebrae to assess bone quality",
    "summary_full": "This paper presents a novel, high-precision method for ex vivo cyclic compressive loading of isolated mouse vertebral bodies, addressing challenges posed by the small size of these bones and machine compliance. The method incorporates 3D-printed jigs for precise machining of vertebral surfaces, pivotable loading platens for uniform contact, and specimen-specific micro-CT-based finite element analysis to determine stiffness and prescribe forces that ensure a consistent strain level across all specimens. When compared to two common literature methods, this new approach significantly reduced scatter in mechanical behavior, particularly in fatigue life measurements, with a standard deviation up to 5-fold lower. The improved precision is expected to enhance statistical power in small-animal studies, aiding in the elucidation of bone quality aspects related to aging, disease, and treatment.",
