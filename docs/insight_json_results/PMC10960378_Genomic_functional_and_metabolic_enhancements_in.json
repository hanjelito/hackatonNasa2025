    "summary_full": "This study investigates the genomic, functional, and metabolic adaptations of Enterobacter bugandensis strains isolated from the International Space Station (ISS). Compared to terrestrial strains, ISS E. bugandensis exhibits distinct genomic clades and functional profiles, with an enrichment of genes related to amino acid transport, metabolism, and stress response, potentially driven by the unique space environment. These strains also possess multidrug resistance mechanisms. Metagenomic analysis revealed the persistence and temporal succession of E. bugandensis across various ISS locations and missions. Metabolic modeling indicated that E. bugandensis can provide metabolic benefits to coexisting Gram-positive bacteria and other microbes, while receiving limited support itself, suggesting its competitive advantage. The study highlights the need for robust preventive measures to mitigate risks associated with pathogenic threats in space environments.",
