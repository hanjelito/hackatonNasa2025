    "document_title": "Draft Genome Sequences of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa Strains Isolated from the International Space Station",
    "summary_full": "This study presents the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of 28 Rhodotorula mucilaginosa isolates obtained from the International Space Station (ISS). R. mucilaginosa is a pigmented yeast known for producing carotenoids, which have biological benefits and pharmaceutical potential. It is also an emerging human pathogen capable of forming biofilms. Given the harsh conditions on the ISS (microgravity and radiation) can enhance antimicrobial resistance and biofilm formation, characterizing these ISS strains is crucial for developing countermeasures against this potential threat to life support systems. The WGS were generated using Illumina Nextera Flex protocol and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 platform. Quality control and assembly were performed using fastp and SPAdes, with assembly quality assessed by QUAST. The generated genome statistics are detailed in Table 1, and the WGS data has been deposited in DDBJ/ENA/GenBank.",
