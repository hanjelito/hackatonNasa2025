    "summary_full": "This study investigated the impact of gravitational mechanical unloading (MU) on human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). MU for 24 hours led to a significant decrease in gene expression of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-Selectin) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α), as well as reduced cell surface expression of these molecules. Conversely, MU increased the expression of eNOS, Caveolin-1, and Caveolin-2, along with nitrite concentration. Cell morphology also changed, with a decrease in length and width. Importantly, short periods of mechanical loading (ML) during MU were sufficient to reverse these changes. The study also observed similar effects in a mouse hindlimb suspension model. The findings suggest that gravitational forces significantly influence endothelial cell function, potentially through cytoskeletal changes, and that artificial gravity could mitigate these effects.",

    "conclusions": "Gravitational mechanical unloading significantly alters endothelial cell phenotype, leading to an 'anti-inflammatory' state characterized by reduced adhesion molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines, alongside increased eNOS and caveolin expression. These changes are likely mediated by cytoskeletal alterations and can be reversed by mechanical loading. Caveolae appear to play a role as gravity-sensing elements, highlighting the plasticity of endothelial cells in response to gravitational forces.",
