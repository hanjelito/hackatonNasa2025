    "summary_full": "This study presents a novel method for desiccating and preserving single yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) within hollow microparticles called PicoShells. These PicoShells, with a porous hydrogel shell and a hollow aqueous core, allow for nutrient and waste exchange, enabling uninhibited cell growth and flexible assay protocols. The desiccation method, involving vacuum drying in oil with trehalose, preserves particle morphology and porosity, with minimal changes observed after multi-week storage. Yeast viability remains high (only a 14% decrease compared to non-desiccated controls over 8.5 weeks), although initial growth potential is reduced. The researchers demonstrate a proof-of-concept for growth rate-based single-cell analysis on rehydrated PicoShells, successfully identifying a subpopulation with accelerated growth. This technology offers a robust, low-resource workflow for cell preservation and single-cell analysis in space exploration, facilitating the study of microbial population heterogeneity.",
