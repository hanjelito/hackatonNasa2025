    "summary_full": "This study investigated the impact of simulated microgravity, partial gravity (Moon), and hypergravity (2g and 4g) on the growth and morphology of Wolffia globosa, a promising candidate for space-based agriculture. Using random positioning machines and a large-diameter centrifuge, researchers found that while microgravity and Moon gravity slightly reduced relative growth rates (RGR) compared to Earth gravity, the plants maintained substantial growth. Hypergravity treatments showed a trend towards increased RGR, though not statistically significant. Morphological analysis revealed that microgravity and Moon gravity conditions led to more elongated fronds, while hypergravity resulted in shorter fronds. Despite slight growth reductions under simulated low gravity, Wolffia globosa demonstrated adaptability to varying gravitational environments, reinforcing its potential for bioregenerative life support systems and space exploration.",

    "conclusions": "Wolffia globosa demonstrates a slight but significant response to altered gravitational conditions, with reduced growth under simulated microgravity and Moon gravity, and a trend towards increased growth under hypergravity. Morphological changes, particularly frond elongation, were observed under low-gravity conditions. Despite these variations, the plant maintains substantial growth rates, underscoring its adaptability and potential as a resilient crop for space-based agriculture and bioregenerative life support systems.",
