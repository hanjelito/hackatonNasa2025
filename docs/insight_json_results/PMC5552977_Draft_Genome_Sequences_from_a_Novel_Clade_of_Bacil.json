    "summary_full": "This paper presents the draft genome sequences of six Bacillus strains isolated from the International Space Station (ISS). These strains belong to the Bacillus anthracis-B. cereus-B. thuringiensis group and were isolated from different modules of the ISS. Four of the strains were sequenced using both Illumina MiSeq and PacBio RSII platforms, while the remaining two were sequenced using only Illumina MiSeq. The genomes were assembled using IDBA-UD and SPAdes, with IDBA-UD selected as the best assembly. Low confidence bases were masked, and PacBio assemblies were polished with Quiver and Pilon. Comparative genomic analysis showed high similarity among the ISS isolates and to members of the B. cereus sensu lato group. Notably, these isolates lack key pathogenicity elements of B. anthracis, including the pXO1 and pXO2 plasmids, and possess the ancestral \"C\" allele of the plcR gene, placing them phylogenetically outside the B. anthracis clade. The collective genomic evidence supports the conclusion that these six ISS isolates represent a novel Bacillus sp. within the B. cereus sensu lato group.",

    "conclusions": "The six Bacillus strains isolated from the ISS represent a novel clade within the B. cereus sensu lato group. Their genomic analysis indicates they are distinct from B. anthracis, lacking its characteristic virulence plasmids and possessing an ancestral plcR allele. This suggests a unique evolutionary trajectory for these space-borne bacteria.",
