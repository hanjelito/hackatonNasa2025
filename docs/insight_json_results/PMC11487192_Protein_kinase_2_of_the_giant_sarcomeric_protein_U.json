    "summary_full": "UNC-89 is a large sarcomeric protein in C. elegans with two kinase domains, PK1 and PK2. This study investigates the role of PK2, demonstrating it is a catalytically active kinase. By mutating a key lysine residue in PK2 (KtoA) to inactivate its kinase activity, researchers observed that while sarcomere structure and muscle function remained normal, even improving in some aspects (faster movement), mitochondria became fragmented. This fragmentation was linked to increased association of the fission protein DRP-1 with mitochondria. Despite mitochondrial fragmentation, which often impairs function, the PK2 KtoA mutants exhibited increased ATP levels, increased glycolysis, and altered electron transport chain (ETC) complex levels. Specifically, complex I respiration was increased and already uncoupled, while complex II respiration was decreased. The uncoupled state was attributed to increased levels of the uncoupling protein UCP-4. These findings suggest a signaling pathway from sarcomeres to mitochondria, mediated by UNC-89 PK2, that regulates mitochondrial morphology and function to match energy production with cellular demands.",

    "conclusions": "The study demonstrates that the PK2 kinase domain of the giant sarcomeric protein UNC-89 is catalytically active and plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial morphology and function. Inactivation of PK2 leads to mitochondrial fragmentation, increased DRP-1 association with mitochondria, altered mitochondrial respiration, increased glycolysis, and elevated UCP-4 levels, while surprisingly maintaining normal sarcomere structure and improving locomotion. These findings suggest a signaling pathway from the sarcomere to mitochondria that coordinates energy production with cellular demands.",
