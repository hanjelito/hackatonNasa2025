    "document_title": "Correction to: Succession and persistence of microbial communities and antimicrobial resistance genes associated with International Space Station environmental surfaces",
    "summary_full": "This document is a correction to a previously published article in Microbiome (2018) 6:204. The correction addresses a typographic error in the scientific notation for the number of sequencing reads. The corrected text clarifies that approximately 7.3 × 10^8 reads associated with microorganisms were generated after quality trimming from both PMA and non-PMA treated samples. All metagenomic reads were normalized to a total of 3.1 × 10^8, with 7.4 × 10^6 assigned to each sample, and this normalization did not affect the taxonomic diversity. The authors apologize for the error.",
