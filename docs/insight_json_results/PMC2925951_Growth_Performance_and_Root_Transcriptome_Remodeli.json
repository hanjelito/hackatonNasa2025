    "summary_full": "This study investigates the impact of high magnesium sulfate (MgSO4·7H2O) concentrations, found in Martian regolith, on Arabidopsis growth and root gene expression. While disabling specific ion transporters (AtMRS2-10 and AtSULTR1;2) did not confer tolerance, the cax1-1 mutant showed partial tolerance to elevated MgSO4·7H2O. Transcriptome analysis of wild-type Arabidopsis roots exposed to high MgSO4·7H2O revealed early responses involving hormone metabolism, transcription factors, calcium-binding proteins, kinases, cell wall proteins, and membrane transporters. Over 200 transporter genes were differentially expressed, with CAX1 being downregulated early. The comparison between cax1-1 and wild-type at 180 minutes showed minimal transcriptional differences, suggesting that the CAX1-mediated response is a significant early adaptation. The findings provide a basis for developing Mars soil-compatible plants by identifying candidate genes for enhancing tolerance to magnesium sulfate stress.",

    "conclusions": "The study demonstrates that while targeting specific Mg2+ and SO4 2− transporters like AtMRS2-10 and AtSULTR1;2 is not effective for conferring tolerance to high magnesium sulfate, the cax1 mutant shows partial tolerance. The early transcriptome response in wild-type Arabidopsis involves a broad range of genes, including those related to hormone signaling and ion transport, with CAX1 being a key early player. The limited transcriptional differences between cax1-1 and wild-type at a later time point suggest that the adaptive mechanisms are complex and may involve post-transcriptional regulation or slower responses. These findings provide a valuable foundation for developing Mars soil-compatible plants by identifying a reduced set of candidate genes for genetic engineering.",
