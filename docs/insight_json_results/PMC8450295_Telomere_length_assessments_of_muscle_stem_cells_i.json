    "document_title": "Telomere length assessments of muscle stem cells in rodent and human skeletal muscle sections",
    "summary_full": "This paper describes a protocol called cryosection muscle quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (CRYO MuQ-FISH) for measuring telomere length in muscle stem cells (MuSCs) within their native skeletal muscle environment. This method uses cryosections of muscle tissue, preserving the MuSC niche, and employs a free software (Telometer) for single-cell level telomere length assessment based on fluorescence intensity. The protocol details steps for tissue preparation, cryosectioning, CRYO MuQ-FISH staining, image acquisition, and data analysis, including normalization methods. It is adaptable for archival samples and can be applied to rodent and human tissues, as well as other tissue types. The method was validated by comparing results with a previously established method using isolated MuSCs, showing similar patterns of telomere shortening in disease models.",
