    "summary_full": "This paper describes the development and characterization of a Multi-analyte Biochip (MAB) that utilizes All-solid-state Ion-selective Electrodes (ASSISE) for monitoring physiological parameters. The MAB is designed for lab-on-a-chip applications in various research fields, including spaceflight, by employing poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) as a conductive polymer transducer layer to enhance electrode stability and lifetime. The MAB can simultaneously quantify H+, Ca2+, and CO32- ions, with operational ranges of pH 4-9, 0.01 mM - 1 mM for CO32-, and 0.01 mM to 1 mM for Ca2+. The device demonstrated stable performance, including a near-Nernstian slope response for pH after one month of storage in algal medium. The MAB was successfully used to monitor the physiological activity, specifically photosynthesis, of the microalga Chlorella vulgaris by detecting changes in carbonate ion concentration under different light conditions. The compact size, versatility, and multiplexed sensing capabilities make the MAB suitable for confined monitoring environments on Earth and in space.",
