    "summary_full": "This paper presents a comprehensive, open-source solution for collecting, analyzing, and classifying the altered gravity environments experienced during parabolic flights. The authors developed a method that is independent of accelerometer orientation and allows for unsupervised classification of all flight phases, providing a consistent approach to quantifying gravito-inertial accelerations (GIA). This solution was validated during a Boeing 727-200F flight with 20 parabolas, and all data and analysis code are freely available. The methodology involves using a small, commercially available accelerometer, filtering the data, and employing change point detection to identify stable g-levels and transitions. The results demonstrate accurate classification of 'parabola', 'hypergravity', and 'other' flight phases, with specific characterizations of g-levels and durations for different types of parabolas (0 g, lunar g, Mars g). The authors emphasize the importance of data availability and validated processing methods for advancing research and planning for future space activities, suggesting their approach could be adapted for other microgravity simulation methods.",
