    "document_title": "A Compact Imaging Platform for Conducting C. elegans Phenotypic Assays on Earth and in Spaceflight",
    "summary_full": "This study introduces a 3D-printed Compact Imaging Platform (CIP) designed for high-throughput phenotypic assays of Caenorhabditis elegans, suitable for both Earth-based research and spaceflight applications. The CIP integrates with a smartphone camera, eliminating the need for external optics and mechanical focusing, thus simplifying its design and operation. It is compact, USB-powered, and can be housed in incubators for temperature control, making it plug-and-play and suitable for parallel operation. The platform demonstrates compatibility with various C. elegans substrates, including agar plates, liquid droplets, and microfluidic chips. Validation through behavioral and thrashing assays shows phenotypic readouts consistent with literature data. A pilot study with mutants (unc-32 and unc-79) successfully distinguished their distinct phenotypes, highlighting the CIP's utility for mutant characterization. The authors emphasize the CIP's suitability for spaceflight due to its small size, low weight, and ease of use, addressing limitations of current microscopy systems on the International Space Station.",
