    "summary_full": "This study investigated the molecular effects of spaceflight on energy metabolism and sex hormone signaling in mice and humans. Gene expression analysis revealed that spaceflight significantly altered pathways related to insulin and estrogen signaling in both species. In mice, the liver showed the most pronounced changes, with inhibited insulin and estrogen receptor signaling, leading to hepatic insulin resistance and steatosis. Different muscle types exhibited varying responses to insulin and estrogen signaling pathways based on their metabolic demands. In humans, pathway analysis of astronaut data indicated changes in insulin resistance, estrogen signaling, stress response, and viral infection pathways. The findings suggest that space travel has significant metabolic and endocrinological consequences, highlighting the need for further research to develop countermeasures for long-duration space missions.",

    "conclusions": "Spaceflight significantly alters gene expression profiles related to insulin and estrogen signaling in both rodents and humans, impacting key metabolic pathways in organs like the liver and muscles. These changes suggest potential for developing insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, and other metabolic dysfunctions. The findings underscore the critical need for further research into the metabolic and endocrinological effects of space travel to ensure the health and success of future interplanetary missions.",
