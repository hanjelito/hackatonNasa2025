    "document_title": "Modeling Host-Pathogen Interactions in the Context of the Microenvironment: Three-Dimensional Cell Culture Comes of Age",
    "summary_full": "This review discusses the limitations of traditional 2D cell culture models for studying host-pathogen interactions and highlights the advancements and applications of three-dimensional (3D) cell culture models. These 3D models, including rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors, organoids, and organ-on-a-chip (OAC) systems, better recapitulate the complex microenvironment of native tissues, incorporating 3D architecture, multicellular complexity, and physiological forces. The review details how these models have been used to study various pathogens, providing more physiologically relevant and predictive frameworks for understanding infection mechanisms and developing antimicrobial therapies. It also addresses the limitations and future directions for each model type, emphasizing the need for continued development to better mimic in vivo conditions.",
