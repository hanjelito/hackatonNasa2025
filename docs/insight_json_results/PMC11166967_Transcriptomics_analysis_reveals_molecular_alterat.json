    "summary_full": "This study investigates the molecular changes in skin due to spaceflight by analyzing transcriptomic data from mice and astronauts. Key findings indicate that spaceflight induces alterations in genes related to skin health, DNA damage and repair, and mitochondrial function. These changes are associated with potential drivers of skin health risks in astronauts. The research also highlights the body's ability to re-adapt gene expression post-flight. Machine learning models were used to identify gene pairings associated with spaceflight responses. The findings can inform the development of countermeasures to mitigate spaceflight-induced skin damage.",
