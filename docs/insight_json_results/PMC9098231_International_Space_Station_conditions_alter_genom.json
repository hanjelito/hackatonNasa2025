    "summary_full": "This study presents the first comprehensive genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analysis of the fungus Aspergillus nidulans grown on the International Space Station (ISS). The research utilized wild-type and three mutant strains, including genetically engineered ones for enhanced secondary metabolite production. Whole genome sequencing revealed specific genomic alterations in response to ISS conditions. Notably, in a strain overexpressing the regulator laeA, the stop codon was lost. Proteomic analysis showed differential protein expression related to stress response, carbohydrate metabolism, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Metabolomic analysis indicated decreased prenyl xanthone production in the wild-type strain and increased asperthecin production in strains deficient in DNA repair. These findings offer insights into A. nidulans' adaptation mechanisms in spacecraft environments and highlight its potential as a platform for drug production in space.",
