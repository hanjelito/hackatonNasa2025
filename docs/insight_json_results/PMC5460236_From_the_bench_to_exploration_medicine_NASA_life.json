    "document_title": "From the bench to exploration medicine: NASA life sciences translational research for human exploration and habitation missions",
    "summary_full": "This paper advocates for and outlines a path forward for translational research at NASA, aiming to accelerate the development of countermeasures for human spaceflight. It highlights the need for bi-directional information flow between basic and applied life sciences and medical operations to address health and safety challenges in exploration missions beyond low-Earth orbit. The paper draws parallels with the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) translational science model and proposes a two-phased approach: basic-to-applied and applied-to-operational. It provides examples of early-stage translational research in areas such as immune response, microbe-host interactions, oxidative stress, and visual impairment, demonstrating synergy between NASA's Space Biology and Human Research Programs. The authors recommend building partnerships, fostering new collaborations, embracing open science, and enhancing education and advocacy to catalyze translational research and support NASA's goals for human space exploration.",
