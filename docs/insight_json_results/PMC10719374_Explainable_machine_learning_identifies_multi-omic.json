    "summary_full": "This study investigates the molecular mechanisms behind muscle atrophy during spaceflight by analyzing multi-omics data (transcriptomic, proteomic, and DNA methylation) from mouse soleus (SOL) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles exposed to microgravity. Using the QLattice symbolic regression algorithm, researchers developed explainable machine learning models to predict calcium reuptake levels and experimental conditions based on these multi-omics features. Key findings indicate that Acyp1 and Rps7 proteins are significant biomarkers for the resilience of the TA muscle, with Acyp1 downregulation correlating with improved calcium reuptake in TA, while impaired calcium reuptake in SOL is linked to the upregulation of several genes. The study highlights the utility of explainable AI in identifying potential targets for countermeasures against spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy.",

    "conclusions": "The study successfully employed explainable machine learning to identify multi-omics biomarkers associated with muscle response to spaceflight, particularly concerning calcium reuptake. Acyp1 and Rps7 emerged as key indicators of TA muscle resilience, while specific gene expression patterns were linked to SOL muscle impairment. These findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms of spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy and suggest potential targets for future countermeasures.",
