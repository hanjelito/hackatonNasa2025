    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of spaceflight on astronauts using liquid biopsies, analyzing plasma cell-free RNA (cfRNA) from six astronauts before, during, and after a long-duration mission on the International Space Station (ISS). The analysis confirmed previous findings of mitochondrial dysregulation in space and identified a specific fraction of cell-free mitochondrial DNA and RNA associated with the scavenger receptor CD36. RNA sequencing of this CD36-enriched fraction revealed tissue-specific RNA species, suggesting that plasma mitochondrial components originate from various tissues. A cross-species comparison with mouse data from a mission utilizing artificial gravity indicated that microgravity is a key factor in the observed mitochondrial responses. The findings suggest that plasma cfRNA can serve as a minimally invasive biomarker for monitoring physiological changes in astronauts and provide insights into tissue-specific responses to the space environment, potentially aiding in the development of countermeasures for space exploration.",

    "conclusions": "Spaceflight induces the release of cell-free mitochondrial DNA and RNA into the plasma, associated with CD36-marked extracellular vesicles, which reflects systemic mitochondrial stress and tissue-specific responses. This phenomenon, particularly linked to microgravity, highlights the potential of liquid biopsies for monitoring astronaut health and understanding spaceflight-induced physiological changes.",
