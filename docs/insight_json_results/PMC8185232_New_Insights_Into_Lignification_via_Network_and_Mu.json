    "summary_full": "This study investigates the systemic effects of reduced lignin levels in Arabidopsis thaliana by analyzing multiple arogenate dehydratase (ADT) knock-out (KO) mutants with varying lignin content. Integrated multi-omics analyses (metabolome, transcriptome, and proteome) were performed on wild-type (WT) and ADT KO lines. Network analysis of proteins correlated with stem lignin levels revealed novel putative lignin-related proteins and processes, including those involved in ribosomes, the spliceosome, mRNA transport, aminoacyl tRNA biosynthesis, and phosphorylation. This suggests that lignin biosynthesis regulation extends beyond transcriptional control to include post-transcriptional and translational mechanisms, potentially involving a \"ribocode.\" The study also identified significant changes in various metabolic pathways, such as glucosinolate, carotenoid, and phenylpropanoid metabolism, with increased carotenoid and galactolipid levels and decreased glucosinolate and phenylpropanoid levels in KO mutants. The findings propose a more comprehensive model of lignin biosynthesis and identify new protein targets for further research and bioengineering.",

    "conclusions": "This study demonstrates that arogenate dehydratases play a crucial role in regulating lignin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. The integration of multi-omics data and network analysis has revealed novel insights into the complex regulatory mechanisms of lignin deposition, extending beyond transcriptional control to include post-transcriptional and translational processes. The identification of proteins associated with ribosomes, the spliceosome, and mRNA processing suggests a potential \"ribocode\" and highlights the importance of these mechanisms in modulating lignin levels. These findings provide a foundation for developing more accurate models of lignin biosynthesis and for identifying new targets for plant bioengineering.",
