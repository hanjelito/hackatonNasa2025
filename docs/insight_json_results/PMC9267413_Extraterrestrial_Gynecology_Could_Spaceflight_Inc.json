    "document_title": "Extraterrestrial Gynecology: Could Spaceflight Increase the Risk of Developing Cancer in Female Astronauts? An Updated Review",
    "summary_full": "This review examines the potential increased risk of gynecological cancers in female astronauts due to spaceflight, specifically microgravity and ionizing radiation. While terrestrial data shows women have a higher incidence of radiation-induced cancers, research on spaceflight's impact on the female reproductive system is limited. The paper discusses the known effects of microgravity and radiation on human physiology and their potential implications for gynecological health, including fertility and cancer development. It highlights the scarcity of human data and the challenges in extrapolating from terrestrial studies. The review also covers current medical standards for female astronauts, potential countermeasures, and future research needs to ensure the safety of women in long-duration space missions, particularly with upcoming lunar and Martian exploration.",

    "conclusions": "There is a significant knowledge gap regarding the impact of space radiation and microgravity on gynecological cancers. The limited number of female astronauts exposed to long-duration, low-dose rate radiation makes it difficult to establish definitive risks. With upcoming longer missions, such as the Artemis program, understanding these risks is crucial for ensuring astronaut safety, particularly as gonadal tissues are highly sensitive to radiation. Further research is urgently needed to address this gap.",
    "impact_statement": "This review highlights the critical need for research into the risks of gynecological cancers for female astronauts, essential for ensuring the safety and feasibility of future long-duration space exploration missions."
