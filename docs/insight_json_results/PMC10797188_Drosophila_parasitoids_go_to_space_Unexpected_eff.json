    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of spaceflight on Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies and their natural parasitoid wasps. The experiment involved naive and parasitized flies from a control strain and a tumor-bearing mutant strain, sent to the International Space Station (ISS) for 34 days. Results showed that spaceflight activated inflammation-related genes in both fly strains. Surprisingly, the control flies were more sensitive to spaceflight, with downregulation of essential genes, while tumor burden increased in the space-returned tumor-bearing mutants. The parasitoid wasps appeared more resilient, with no significant impact on their survival or virulence gene expression. Notably, previously undocumented mutant wasps with altered wing color and shape were isolated post-flight, offering valuable resources for future research.",

    "conclusions": "Spaceflight has differential and unexpected effects on Drosophila hosts and their parasitoid wasps. While inflammation is generally activated, control flies are more susceptible to spaceflight stressors than tumor-bearing mutants. Parasitoids are resilient, maintaining their virulence and survival, and even exhibiting novel mutations. These findings highlight the complexity of host-parasite interactions in space and the potential for generating new research tools.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals that spaceflight can alter host-parasite dynamics and generate novel genetic variations in insects, providing insights into biological adaptation to space and potential risks for future space missions."
