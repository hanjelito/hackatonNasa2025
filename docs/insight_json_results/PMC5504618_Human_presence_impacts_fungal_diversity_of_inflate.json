    "document_title": "Human presence impacts fungal diversity of inflated lunar/Mars analog habitat",
    "summary_full": "This study investigated the changes in fungal diversity within an inflatable lunar/Mars analog habitat (ILMAH) during a 30-day human occupation. Using both traditional culture-based methods and advanced molecular techniques (iTag Illumina sequencing with propidium monoazide treatment to distinguish viable fungi), researchers characterized the mycobiome. They found that human presence significantly altered the fungal community structure, with an increase in diversity and a decrease in overall fungal burden over time. Notably, samples collected at day 20 showed a distinct fungal profile. Several fungal families, including Davidiellaceae, Teratosphaeriaceae, Pleosporales, and Pleosporaceae, increased in abundance during occupation, with genera like Epicoccum, Alternaria, Pleosporales, Davidiella, and Cryptococcus showing increased prevalence. The study highlights the importance of maintaining closed habitats to prevent deterioration and ensure crew safety.",

    "conclusions": "The study concludes that human presence significantly alters the fungal diversity within a closed habitat like the ILMAH. While cultivable fungal counts decreased over time, molecular analysis revealed an increase in viable fungal diversity and the prevalence of certain fungal genera. These findings underscore the necessity for proper maintenance protocols in closed habitats to prevent deterioration and ensure the health and safety of inhabitants.",
    "impact_statement": "This research provides crucial insights into the microbial ecology of closed habitats, informing the design and maintenance of future extraterrestrial human settlements and highlighting potential health risks associated with fungal presence."
