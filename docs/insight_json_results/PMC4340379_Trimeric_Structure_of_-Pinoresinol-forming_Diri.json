    "summary_full": "This study reports the three-dimensional structure of (+)-pinoresinol-forming dirigent protein (PsDRR206) at 1.95 Å resolution. PsDRR206 forms a tightly packed trimer, with each monomer adopting an eight-stranded β-barrel topology. The structure reveals three spatially separated putative substrate binding sites on the trimer surface, suggesting that monomer coupling occurs directly within each site rather than between sites on different monomers. Computational docking studies indicate that these sites can accommodate coniferyl alcohol radicals (CA•) and are positioned to facilitate stereoselective coupling. The research also identifies six differentially conserved residues between (+)- and (−)-pinoresinol-forming dirigent proteins, proposing their role in determining stereoselectivity. The findings provide new insights into the mechanism of monolignol radical-radical coupling in plants.",
