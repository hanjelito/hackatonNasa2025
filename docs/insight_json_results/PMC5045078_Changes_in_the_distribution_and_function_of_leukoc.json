    "summary_full": "This study investigated the long-term effects of whole-body iron ion irradiation (56Fe) on the immune system of C57BL/6 mice, 40 days post-exposure to doses of 0, 1, 2, and 3 gray (Gy). While organ masses like spleen, liver, and lung remained unchanged, thymus mass increased significantly in irradiated groups. In the blood, red blood cell counts, hemoglobin, and hematocrit decreased at 3 Gy, and CD8+ T cytotoxic cell counts and percentages were reduced across irradiated groups, leading to an elevated CD4:CD8 ratio. Conversely, splenic B cell counts and percentages, as well as T helper cell counts, were elevated in some irradiated groups. Bone marrow showed reduced percentages of stem cell markers (Sca-1 and CD34/Sca-1) in higher dose groups. Spontaneous blastogenesis in blood increased with irradiation, but mitogen-induced responses in the spleen were not significantly affected. The findings indicate persistent immunological abnormalities more than a month after iron ion irradiation, with compartment-specific differences.",
