    "summary_full": "This study develops novel microfluidic technologies to analyze the effects of cyanide toxicity on Caenorhabditis elegans with high spatiotemporal resolution. The researchers investigated the genetic basis of cyanide resistance, focusing on the egl-9 mutant, which is known to be resistant to hydrogen cyanide (HCN). They found that this resistance is dependent on the HIF-1 hypoxia-inducible factor and is mediated by the cysl-2 cysteine synthase, which likely inactivates cyanide through metabolic pathways. The expression level of cysl-2 correlated with the degree of cyanide resistance observed in different genetic backgrounds. The developed microfluidic assay, combined with real-time imaging, provides detailed behavioral parameters that are crucial for analyzing subtle phenotypes and holds potential for monitoring toxicant effects and studying resistance mechanisms.",
