    "document_title": "Draft Genome Sequences of Bacillaceae Strains Isolated from the International Space Station",
    "summary_full": "This study reports the draft genome sequences of 29 bacterial isolates from the family Bacillaceae, collected from various surfaces on the International Space Station (ISS). The isolates were identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Paenibacillus polymyxa. Samples were collected using sterile wipes, processed on Earth, and DNA was extracted. Whole-genome sequencing was performed using Illumina technology, and data quality was assessed and filtered. Genome assembly was carried out using SPAdes, and quality was evaluated with QUAST. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) was calculated to confirm species identification. The generated genome sequences are valuable for understanding the adaptation and potential biotechnological applications of these bacteria in space environments and for NASA's planetary protection protocols.",
