    "document_title": "Sierra Nevada sweep: metagenomic measurements of bioaerosols vertically distributed across the troposphere",
    "summary_full": "This study investigated the composition and diversity of airborne microbial communities (bioaerosols) at different altitudes (10,000 ft to 40,000 ft) over the Sierra Nevada mountain range using NASA's C-20A aircraft. Bioaerosols were analyzed via metagenomic DNA sequencing and traditional culturing. The relative abundance of microbial taxa changed significantly with altitude, and the microbiome composition varied between the two sampling days, indicating a dynamic atmospheric microbiome. Specific genera like Mycobacterium, Achromobacter, Stenotrophomonas, Delftia, Pseudoperonospora, Alcaligenes, and Penicillium were found to be proportionally abundant at different altitudes. Viable bacteria, including Bacillus species, were also identified in the upper troposphere. The researchers developed a human exposure likelihood model to estimate bioaerosol dispersal and potential downwind impacts. By integrating metagenomic data with atmospheric modeling, this study aims to advance the monitoring of global bioaerosol emissions and their effects.",
