    "summary_full": "This study establishes a swim exercise regimen for the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate the systemic benefits of exercise on aging. The researchers found that multiple daily swim sessions in early adulthood are crucial for inducing long-lasting adaptations in various tissues, including body wall muscle, pharynx, intestine, and nervous system. The exercise regimen improved muscle gene expression, locomotion, mitochondrial morphology, and whole-animal mitochondrial respiration. It also extended pharyngeal and intestinal healthspans, enhanced learning ability, and protected against neurodegeneration in models of tauopathy, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease. Notably, these benefits persisted well into midlife, even after the exercise period ended. The study also demonstrated that exercise in postreproductive worms can improve locomotory vigor, suggesting exercise benefits are achievable at different life stages.",

    "conclusions": "Long-term swim exercise in early adult C. elegans induces robust, system-wide health benefits that extend neuromuscular, gut, and cognitive healthspan, and protect against neurodegeneration. These benefits are long-lasting, underscoring the potent impact of early exercise on aging trajectories and establishing C. elegans as a valuable model for dissecting the molecular mechanisms of exercise-dependent health.",
    "impact_statement": "This study demonstrates that exercise in a simple model organism can confer broad, long-lasting health benefits across multiple tissues, providing a foundation for understanding how exercise promotes healthy aging and protects against age-related diseases."
