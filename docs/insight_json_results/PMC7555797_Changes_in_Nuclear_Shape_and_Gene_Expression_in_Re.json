    "summary_full": "This study investigates the role of the Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex in cellular responses to simulated microgravity (SMG). Using human breast epithelial cells (MCF 10A) and a 3-D clinostat, researchers found that changes in nuclear shape induced by SMG are dependent on an intact LINC complex. Short-term (2h) SMG exposure caused nuclear elongation in control cells, while LINC-disrupted cells showed no significant change. Long-term (20h) SMG exposure led to nuclear flattening in control cells and nuclear elongation in LINC-disrupted cells, indicating a time-dependent and LINC-dependent nuclear shape response. Furthermore, RNA sequencing revealed that SMG significantly alters gene expression, and this alteration is also LINC-dependent. Disruption of the LINC complex led to a greater number of differentially expressed genes, with some genes showing reversed or altered sensitivity to SMG. Pathway analysis indicated that LINC disruption in SMG affects pathways related to cell cycle, cytoskeleton, cell adhesion, and mitochondria. These findings suggest that the LINC complex is crucial for transmitting mechanical signals from gravity to the nucleus, influencing both nuclear morphology and gene expression, with implications for understanding cellular adaptation to spaceflight and potential risks for long-duration missions.",
