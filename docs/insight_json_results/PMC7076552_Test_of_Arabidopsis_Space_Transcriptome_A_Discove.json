    "summary_full": "This paper introduces the Test Of Arabidopsis Space Transcriptome (TOAST) database, a novel computational system designed to analyze and visualize plant biology omics data from spaceflight experiments. Addressing the challenges of data accessibility, interoperability, and complex analysis, TOAST integrates data from NASA's GeneLab and other repositories using Qlik software. It provides a gene-centric platform for interactive comparisons across multiple experiments, facilitating the exploration of gene expression patterns, functional gene ontology, and KEGG pathways. TOAST not only confirms known spaceflight responses, such as oxidative stress modulation, but also reveals new insights, like widespread changes in mitochondrial function. The database supports cross-species comparisons and includes a metadata app for exploring experimental design factors. TOAST aims to make complex plant spaceflight data more accessible to researchers, driving new hypotheses and understanding of plant responses to the space environment.",
