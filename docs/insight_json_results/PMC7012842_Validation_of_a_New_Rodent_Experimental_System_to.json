    "document_title": "Validation of a New Rodent Experimental System to Investigate Consequences of Long Duration Space Habitation",
    "summary_full": "This study validates a new system for long-duration rodent experiments in space, focusing on on-orbit sample recovery to avoid confounding factors from Earth return. Female mice were housed on the International Space Station for 21-22 or 37 days in microgravity. Daily health checks and post-mission analyses revealed that while soleus muscle showed expected atrophy, overall health indicators like body weight, adrenal, and spleen weights were comparable to ground controls. However, 37-day flight mice exhibited increased liver mass and select enzyme activities. The system successfully enabled on-orbit dissection and sample preservation, yielding high-quality RNA and enzyme activity levels, demonstrating a new capability for space-based biological research.",

    "conclusions": "The developed rodent experimental system successfully supports long-duration spaceflight with on-orbit sample recovery, minimizing confounding stress responses. The findings indicate that while microgravity induces specific physiological changes like soleus muscle atrophy and altered liver enzyme activity, the system itself does not appear to induce chronic stress, paving the way for more reliable space-based biological research.",
