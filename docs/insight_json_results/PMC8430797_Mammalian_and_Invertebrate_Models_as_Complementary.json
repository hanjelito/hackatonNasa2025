    "summary_full": "This study investigates the molecular responses of different muscle types (soleus and EDL) in mice to spaceflight, comparing them with transcriptomic data from invertebrate models (C. elegans and D. melanogaster) and ground-based analogs (hindlimb unloading and bed rest). The research aims to maximize scientific output from limited spaceflight omics datasets by identifying shared and discrete molecular responses across species and models. Key findings include shared stress responses and altered circadian rhythms in mouse muscles, with EDL showing more robust growth signals and Pde2a downregulation, potentially contributing to its resistance to atrophy. Invertebrate models, particularly C. elegans, showed similarities to EDL responses, while larval D. melanogaster resembled soleus responses, and adult D. melanogaster showed similarities to EDL. The study also highlights shared gene regulation between human bed rest and space-flown rodents, suggesting potential targets for mitigating muscle atrophy. The findings suggest that while invertebrate models can augment mechanistic knowledge, rodents remain crucial for extrapolating human responses due to physiological similarities.",

    "conclusions": "Spaceflight induces both shared and distinct molecular responses in slow and fast-twitch mouse muscles, with EDL showing greater resistance to atrophy, potentially linked to Pde2a downregulation. Invertebrate models like C. elegans and D. melanogaster exhibit partial similarities to mammalian muscle responses, with life stage influencing the degree of similarity. Ground-based analogs like bed rest and hindlimb unloading show conserved responses with spaceflight, particularly in pathways related to glucose homeostasis and circadian rhythm, suggesting potential targets for countermeasures. The study highlights the value of comparative bioinformatics approaches for maximizing insights from limited spaceflight omics data.",
