    "summary_full": "This study investigates the transcriptomic and phenotypic responses of two Caenorhabditis elegans strains (N2 and AB1) to liquid cultivation, a common method in space, toxicology, and pharmacology studies. The researchers cultured P0 worms on agar, F1 in liquid, and F2 back on agar to assess adaptive responses and their transmission to subsequent generations. Significant variations in gene expression were observed between the N2 and AB1 strains, with 8-34% of environmental change-induced transcriptional responses being transmitted to the next generation. Genotype was found to be a substantial factor in adaptive responses, correlating with observed phenotypic changes. For instance, the N2 strain showed alterations in germline and cuticle gene expression and phenotype in axenic liquid cultivation. The study also identified transcript evidence for approximately 21% of computationally predicted genes in C. elegans by exposing them to environmental changes. The findings highlight substantial differences between the N2 and AB1 strains in their responses to rapid environmental changes and provide valuable control data for future liquid cultivation studies of C. elegans.",

    "conclusions": "Liquid cultivation induces significant transcriptomic and phenotypic changes in C. elegans, with strain-specific differences observed. A portion of these environmentally induced changes are transmitted to the next generation, and genotype is a major determinant of these adaptive responses. The study provides valuable data for future research using liquid cultivation and identifies condition-specific genes, including previously unconfirmed ones and non-coding RNAs, that play roles in adaptation.",
    "impact_statement": "This study provides crucial insights into the effects of liquid cultivation on C. elegans, establishing essential controls for space biology, toxicology, and pharmacology research and revealing novel genes involved in environmental adaptation."
