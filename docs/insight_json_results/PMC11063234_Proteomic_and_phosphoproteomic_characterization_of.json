    "summary_full": "This study investigated the long-term proteomic and phosphoproteomic changes in mouse heart and plasma following a single exposure to simplified Galactic Cosmic Ray (GCR5-ion) radiation, aiming to understand the biological basis of radiation-induced cardiovascular dysfunction. Researchers performed quantitative mass spectrometry on heart tissue (proteome and phosphoproteome) and plasma (proteome only) from mice 8 months post-irradiation. They identified differentially expressed proteins and phosphorylated peptides, revealing significant perturbations in various biological pathways, particularly those related to inflammation, complement activation, and mitochondrial function. A key finding was the increased presence of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in the myocardium of irradiated mice, suggesting a role in sustained inflammation and potential tissue damage. The study concludes that GCR5-ion exposure induces lasting proteomic changes that can contribute to chronic health issues, including cardiovascular dysfunction, and highlights NETs as a significant factor in the long-term response to space radiation.",

    "conclusions": "A single exposure to GCR5-ion radiation induces long-lasting proteomic and phosphoproteomic alterations in mouse cardiovascular tissues and plasma, with inflammation and neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation being key perturbed processes. These changes likely contribute to the previously observed late-onset cardiovascular dysfunction and highlight potential risks for astronauts during long-term space exploration.",
