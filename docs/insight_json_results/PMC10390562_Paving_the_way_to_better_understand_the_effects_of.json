    "summary_full": "This paper outlines a roadmap for understanding and mitigating the neurobehavioral challenges of prolonged spaceflight, particularly for missions to the Moon and Mars. It identifies critical research gaps, including the effects of spaceflight on brain structure and function, the importance of considering sex as a biological variable, the utility of omics technologies for understanding underlying mechanisms, and the neural representation of gravity. The authors emphasize the need for targeted countermeasures and personalized administration schedules to maintain astronaut performance and well-being. The paper also highlights the potential for space research in neurocognitive science to yield significant benefits for the Earth's population.",
