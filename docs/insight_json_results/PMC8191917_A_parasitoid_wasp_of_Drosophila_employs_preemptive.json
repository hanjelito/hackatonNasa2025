    "document_title": "A parasitoid wasp of Drosophila employs preemptive and reactive strategies to deplete its hostâ€™s blood cells",
    "summary_full": "Parasitoid wasps, such as Leptopilina heterotoma (Lh), infect Drosophila larvae and utilize extracellular vesicles (EVs) in their venom to suppress the host's immune system. These EVs are distributed throughout the host's hemolymphatic system and target the lymph gland, a hematopoietic organ. Lh EVs disrupt the posterior signaling center (PSC) of the lymph gland, which is crucial for maintaining progenitor cells and directing differentiation. The EVs are internalized by lymph gland progenitors and macrophages via endocytosis, damaging late endocytic and phagolysosomal compartments. This disruption leads to hematopoietic depletion and prevents the host from producing lamellocytes, which are necessary to encapsulate and neutralize the wasp egg. The study also reveals a previously unrecognized phagocytic role for the lymph gland in cellular immunity and demonstrates that Rab5, a protein involved in endosomal trafficking, is essential for maintaining macrophage identity and suppressing hematopoietic over-proliferation. The wasp's strategy involves both preemptively dismantling the PSC and reactively destroying blood cells, effectively blocking cellular immunity and ensuring parasite survival.",

    "conclusions": "Leptopilina heterotoma parasitoid wasps utilize venom-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) to systematically dismantle the Drosophila host's immune system. These EVs are distributed throughout the hemolymph, target the lymph gland, disrupt the posterior signaling center (PSC), and are internalized by hemocytes, damaging endomembrane compartments and leading to cell death. This preemptive and reactive strategy effectively blocks the host's cellular immunity, preventing the production of effector cells needed to combat the parasite. The study highlights the lymph gland's crucial role in cellular immunity and reveals a previously unrecognized phagocytic function. Rab5 plays a critical role in maintaining macrophage identity and immune quiescence, and its disruption leads to uncontrolled proliferation and lamellocyte differentiation.",
