    "summary_full": "This study investigates the sequential roles of Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 (FGF-2) and Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 (BMP-2) in bone repair. Using MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells, researchers found that FGF-2 significantly promotes cell proliferation and induces genes associated with growth and angiogenesis (e.g., egr-1, vegfA) while suppressing genes related to mineralization (e.g., col1a1, bmp-2). Conversely, BMP-2 strongly stimulates the expression of mineralization-associated genes and promotes mineralization itself, with little effect on growth-related genes. The findings suggest FGF-2 is crucial for the initial proliferation stage of bone repair, while BMP-2 is essential for the subsequent mineralization stage.",

    "conclusions": "FGF-2 plays a critical role in osteoblast proliferation, the initial stage of bone formation, by reprogramming gene expression to favor growth and downregulating mineralization genes. BMP-2 is instrumental in the final stage of bone repair by stimulating differentiation and mineralization. This suggests a sequential application of these factors may be optimal for bone healing.",
    "impact_statement": "This research elucidates the distinct roles of FGF-2 and BMP-2 in bone formation, providing a foundation for developing targeted therapies to enhance fracture healing and bone regeneration."
