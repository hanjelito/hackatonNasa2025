    "summary_full": "This study investigates the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress survival in Arabidopsis thaliana. While ROS are known to attenuate the UPR in mammals and yeast, their role in plants was unclear. The research demonstrates that respiratory burst oxidase homologs (RBOHD and RBOHF) contribute to ROS production during ER stress in plants. Crucially, these RBOH enzymes are necessary for mounting an effective UPR and for plant survival under both temporary and chronic ER stress conditions. The findings suggest a cytoprotective role for RBOH-generated ROS in plants, highlighting a plant-specific mechanism for UPR management.",

    "conclusions": "RBOHD and RBOHF are critical for plant survival under ER stress by contributing to ROS production, which is necessary for mounting an effective UPR. This represents a plant-specific strategy for managing ER stress, where ROS act as protective signals, unlike in mammalian systems where they are detrimental. The study highlights a complex interplay between ROS and UPR signaling, with UPR integrity being crucial for ROS homeostasis and RBOH activity being essential for proper UPR function and stress adaptation.",
