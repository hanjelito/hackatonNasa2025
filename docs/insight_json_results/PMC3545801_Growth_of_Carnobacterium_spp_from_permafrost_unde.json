    "summary_full": "This study investigates the potential for terrestrial life to survive and grow in the Martian subsurface environment by examining microbes from Siberian permafrost. Permafrost is considered a terrestrial analog for the Martian subsurface due to the prevalence of frozen water on Mars. Six bacterial isolates were obtained from Siberian permafrost and identified as species of the genus Carnobacterium. These isolates, along with nine type species of Carnobacterium, were tested for their ability to grow under simulated Martian conditions: low temperature (0 °C), low pressure (7 mbar), and a CO2-enriched anoxic atmosphere (low-PTA conditions). All tested Carnobacterium species demonstrated growth under these conditions, extending the known low-pressure limits for life. The findings suggest that permafrost environments are promising sources for identifying microbes capable of surviving Martian conditions, with implications for astrobiology and planetary protection.",

    "conclusions": "Microbial communities within Siberian permafrost harbor organisms, specifically Carnobacterium species, capable of growth under simulated Martian conditions of low temperature, low pressure, and anoxic CO2-rich atmosphere. These findings suggest that permafrost is a promising environment for isolating microbes adapted to hypobaric and cold conditions, relevant to the search for extraterrestrial life on Mars and for planetary protection strategies. However, it is acknowledged that these conditions represent only a subset of the challenges posed by the Martian environment.",
    "impact_statement": "This study demonstrates that terrestrial microbes, specifically Carnobacterium species found in permafrost, can grow under simulated Martian conditions, significantly impacting the search for life beyond Earth and informing planetary protection measures."
