    "summary_full": "This study investigated the cardiac responses to simulated microgravity using the rat hindlimb unloading (HU) model, hypothesizing increased oxidative damage and altered gene expression related to oxidative response. Researchers examined hearts of male and female rats of different ages subjected to HU for up to 90 days and reambulated for up to 90 days. Results showed sex-dependent changes in oxidative damage markers (8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, 8-OHdG) and antioxidant gene expression. Specifically, three-month-old females exhibited elevated 8-OHdG after 14 days of HU, unlike age-matched males. Nine-month-old males showed no significant difference in 8-OHdG levels after HU. RNA sequencing of nine-month-old males after 14 days of HU revealed upregulation of pathways involved in pro-inflammatory signaling and immune cell activation, along with differential expression of genes associated with cardiovascular disease progression. The findings suggest targeting antioxidant and immune pathways, and considering sex differences for developing countermeasures to maintain cardiovascular health during spaceflight.",

    "conclusions": "Simulated microgravity leads to sex-dependent alterations in cardiac oxidative stress and gene expression. In older male rats, short-term simulated microgravity induces pro-inflammatory and immune activation pathways, as well as genes associated with cardiovascular disease. These findings underscore the need to consider sex differences and target antioxidant and immune pathways for developing effective countermeasures to maintain cardiovascular health during long-duration spaceflight.",
