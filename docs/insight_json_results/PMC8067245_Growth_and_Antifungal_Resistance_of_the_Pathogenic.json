    "summary_full": "This study investigated the cellular and physiological adaptations of Candida albicans, a common opportunistic fungal pathogen, when cultured in microgravity aboard the International Space Station across several missions and using two different bioreactor systems (FPA and FEP bags). The research aimed to understand yeast responses to microgravity for crew safety and to assess biological reproducibility across flight opportunities and hardware. Results indicated that C. albicans generally exhibited a slightly shorter generation time and higher growth propensity in microgravity compared to terrestrial controls. While filamentation rates varied between bioreactors, they were low and not significantly different between flight and ground conditions. A key finding was the increased resistance of yeast to the antifungal agent amphotericin B when challenged during spaceflight, a phenomenon not observed with caspofungin. Colony morphology remained similar between flight and terrestrial samples, contrasting with previous findings in ground-based microgravity analog systems. The study also noted potential cellular adaptations that might compromise membrane integrity, as evidenced by diminished post-flight survival of chilled or frozen cells cultured in microgravity. Overall, yeast cells cultivated in microgravity demonstrated a subset of characteristics associated with virulence, highlighting the importance of understanding these responses for long-duration space missions.",
