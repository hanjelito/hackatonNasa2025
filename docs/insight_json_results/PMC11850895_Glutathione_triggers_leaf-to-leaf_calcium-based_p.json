    "summary_full": "This study identifies glutathione (GSH) as a critical signaling molecule in plants that triggers long-distance, calcium-based defense signaling. In a GSH-deficient mutant of Arabidopsis, defense signaling events were attenuated despite high accumulation of glutamate (Glu), a previously known wound signal. The research demonstrates that GSH, not Glu, is essential for initiating systemic calcium-based defense responses, which in turn activate jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis and regulate plant defense genes. This signaling pathway relies on the glutamate receptor-like 3.3 (GLR3.3) protein. The findings reveal a sophisticated plant defense mechanism against herbivory and pathogen invasion, drawing parallels to animal nervous system signaling.",
