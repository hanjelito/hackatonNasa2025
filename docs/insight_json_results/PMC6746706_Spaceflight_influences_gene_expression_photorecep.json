    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of 35 days of spaceflight on the murine retina. Mice flown on the ISS showed significant alterations in gene expression, with 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) enriched for pathways related to visual perception, phototransduction, and photoreceptor function. Twelve DEGs were associated with retinitis pigmentosa. Spaceflight also led to degradation of cone photoreceptors, increased retinal oxidative stress, and a significant decrease in the thickness of the total retina, retinal pigment epithelium, and choroid layers. These findings suggest that spaceflight can impair retinal performance and potentially lead to visual impairment in astronauts.",
