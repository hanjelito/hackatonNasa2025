    "summary_full": "This study investigated the survival of microorganisms in a Mars-like environment using the MARSBOx payload on a NASA scientific balloon flight to the middle stratosphere (approximately 38 km altitude). Fungal spores of Aspergillus niger and bacterial cells of Salinisphaera shabanensis, Staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis, and Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9 were exposed to stratospheric conditions, including high radiation levels similar to Mars' surface, an artificial Martian atmosphere, and low pressure. Samples were either exposed to full UV-VIS radiation or shielded. After a 5-hour exposure, survival and metabolic changes were assessed. A. niger spores and S. shabanensis cells showed the highest resistance, with significant log reductions but continued viability. S. capitis subsp. capitis survived only under UV-shielded conditions, while Buttiauxella sp. MASE-IM-9 was completely inactivated. The results highlight the varied survival capabilities of spacecraft-associated microorganisms and suggest that pigmented fungi may be particularly resistant to Martian surface conditions.",

    "conclusions": "The MARSBOx balloon mission successfully simulated Martian environmental conditions in the stratosphere, revealing significant variations in microbial survival. Pigmented fungal spores, particularly Aspergillus niger, demonstrated high resistance, suggesting they are likely candidates for forward contamination of Mars. Certain bacteria, like Salinisphaera shabanensis and Staphylococcus capitis subsp. capitis, also showed resilience, especially when shielded from UV radiation, indicating potential for long-term viability within spacecraft. These findings underscore the importance of including fungal spores in planetary protection protocols for Mars missions.",
    "impact_statement": "This study provides crucial data on microbial survival in a Mars-analog environment, informing planetary protection strategies and the search for extraterrestrial life by highlighting the resilience of certain terrestrial microorganisms to space conditions."
