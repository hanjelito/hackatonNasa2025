    "document_title": "Validation of Methods to Assess the Immunoglobulin Gene Repertoire in Tissues Obtained from Mice on the International Space Station",
    "summary_full": "This study aimed to validate methods for assessing the immunoglobulin (Ig) gene repertoire in mouse tissues, particularly for samples collected under the constraints of spaceflight on the International Space Station (ISS). The researchers compared different sample preparation (whole tissue vs. single-cell suspension) and sequencing techniques (Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq) to ensure that these methods do not introduce bias into the antibody repertoire characterization. They developed and validated a bioinformatics workflow for analyzing Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) data, focusing on IgH and IgÎº variable gene usage, junctional regions, and modifications. The study found that whole tissue preparations, when combined with size selection, yield a high number of antibody sequences and comparable results to traditional single-cell suspensions. The developed workflow, which uses multiple mapping techniques and sequence selection, was validated against existing murine antibody repertoire studies and is suitable for future spaceflight experiments.",
