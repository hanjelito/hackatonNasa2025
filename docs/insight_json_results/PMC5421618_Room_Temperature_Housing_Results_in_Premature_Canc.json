    "summary_full": "This study investigated the impact of housing temperature on bone loss in growing female mice, a common preclinical model for osteoporosis. Mice housed at room temperature (22°C) exhibited significant premature cancellous bone loss, particularly in the distal femur, compared to those housed at thermoneutral temperature (32°C). Thermoneutral housing prevented this bone loss and was associated with increased bone marrow adiposity, higher rates of bone formation, and altered gene expression related to bone metabolism. The findings suggest that standard room temperature housing exacerbates bone loss in mice due to differences in thermoregulation between mice and humans, potentially confounding results in osteoporosis research. Thermoneutral housing is proposed as a strategy to improve the validity of mouse models for age-related bone loss.",

    "conclusions": "Housing female mice at standard room temperature (22°C) induces premature cancellous bone loss, likely due to exaggerated thermoregulatory demands that alter energy metabolism and bone signaling pathways. This phenomenon can confound the interpretation of studies using mice as preclinical models for osteoporosis. Thermoneutral housing (32°C) mitigates this bone loss and may represent a more physiologically relevant condition for such research.",
