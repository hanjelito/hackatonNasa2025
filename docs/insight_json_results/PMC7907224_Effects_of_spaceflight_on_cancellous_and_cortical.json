    "document_title": "Effects of spaceflight on cancellous and cortical bone in proximal femur in growing rats",
    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of spaceflight on bone microarchitecture in the proximal femur of growing rats across three different missions (STS-41, STS-57, and STS-62), varying in duration, age, sex, and strain. Using micro-computed tomography (Î¼CT), the researchers assessed cancellous bone volume fraction and cortical thickness. Findings indicate that spaceflight consistently leads to cancellous osteopenia in the femoral head of growing rats, observed in both male Sprague Dawley and Fisher 344 rats, as well as in ovariectomized female Fisher 344 rats. While cancellous bone volume fraction was significantly reduced in flight animals compared to controls in some groups, cortical thickness remained largely unaffected. The study concludes that spaceflight induces cancellous osteopenia in the femoral head, a clinically relevant site for fractures in humans, and suggests this site warrants further investigation in future spaceflight research.",

    "conclusions": "Spaceflight, even for short durations (4-14 days), consistently results in cancellous osteopenia in the femoral head of growing rats across different strains and sexes. While cortical bone thickness is not significantly affected, the loss of cancellous bone in this clinically relevant site suggests an increased risk of fracture under microgravity conditions. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating the proximal femur in future spaceflight studies.",
    "impact_statement": "This research demonstrates that spaceflight induces bone loss in a critical region of the femur, highlighting a potential health risk for astronauts and informing strategies for maintaining skeletal integrity in space."
