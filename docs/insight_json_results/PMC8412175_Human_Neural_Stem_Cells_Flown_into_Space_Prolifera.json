    "summary_full": "This study investigated the behavior of human neural stem cells (NSCs) in the space environment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) for 39.3 days. The NSCs were found to proliferate and maintain expression of key NSC markers. Compared to ground controls, space-flown NSCs exhibited higher oxygen consumption and glycolysis, indicating an increased metabolic state. Upon return to Earth, these cells retained their ability to differentiate into young neurons. Electrophysiological recordings of these space-derived neurons revealed immature membrane properties, including small capacitance and high input resistance, with only incipient action potentials and no detectable spontaneous synaptic events, suggesting an immature neuronal status despite complex morphology. The increased energy requirement of NSCs in space is highlighted as a critical area for future research to mitigate health risks during long-duration space missions.",
