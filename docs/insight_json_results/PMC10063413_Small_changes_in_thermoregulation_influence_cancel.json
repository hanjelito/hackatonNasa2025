    "summary_full": "Mice are typically housed at temperatures below their thermoneutral zone, leading to cold stress and potential cancellous bone loss, which can affect experimental outcomes. This study investigated how minor variations in housing temperature (22°C vs. 26°C) and heat loss (individual vs. group housing with nestlets) impact bone in growing female C57BL/6 J mice. Mice housed individually at room temperature (~22°C) experienced significant cancellous bone loss in the distal femur metaphysis. This bone loss was attenuated but not entirely prevented in mice housed individually at 26°C or group housed at 22°C with nestlets. The findings indicate that modest differences in housing conditions, affecting thermogenesis or heat retention, can significantly influence experimental results related to bone metabolism.",

    "conclusions": "Modest differences in housing conditions, such as a 4°C increase in ambient temperature or group housing with nestlets to reduce heat loss, can significantly attenuate the negative effects of cold stress on bone mass and architecture in growing female mice. These findings highlight the critical importance of controlling thermoregulation in animal housing to ensure the reliability and translatability of experimental results in bone research.",
    "impact_statement": "This study demonstrates that standard laboratory housing conditions can induce bone loss in mice, impacting research outcomes and suggesting that careful control of environmental temperature is crucial for accurate preclinical studies, particularly those related to bone health and spaceflight."
