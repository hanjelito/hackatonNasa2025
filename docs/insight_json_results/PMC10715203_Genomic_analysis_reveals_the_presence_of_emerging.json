    "summary_full": "This study presents the first comprehensive genomic analysis of Klebsiella isolates from the International Space Station (ISS), including phenotypic and genotypic characterization and mobile genetic elements (MGEs). The analysis of K. pneumoniae, K. aerogenes, and K. quasipneumoniae genomes revealed insights into their antimicrobial resistance, virulence, thermotolerance, and disinfectant resistance. Notably, K. quasipneumoniae ST138 demonstrated spatial and temporal persistence on the ISS, likely due to its genetic profile encoding resistance to disinfectants and heavy metals. A yersiniabactin-encoding K. pneumoniae belonging to the high-risk ST101 clone was also identified. The presence of hypervirulent Klebsiella strains on the ISS poses a potential risk to immunocompromised crew members. Furthermore, MGEs carrying virulence loci could transfer genes to other microorganisms, potentially increasing their virulence. Some Klebsiella genomes showed genetic divergence from Earth-based lineages, hypothesized to be due to unique spaceflight environmental pressures. These findings highlight the need for continuous monitoring of microbial communities in space to understand their survival mechanisms and implications for human health.",

    "conclusions": "This study provides the first comprehensive genomic characterization of Klebsiella strains from the ISS, revealing the presence of emerging pathogenic lineages. K. quasipneumoniae ST138 demonstrates significant persistence on the ISS, likely due to intrinsic resistance mechanisms. The identification of a hypervirulent K. pneumoniae ST101 strain carrying virulence factors like yersiniabactin highlights potential health risks for astronauts. The observed genetic adaptations suggest that spaceflight environmental pressures can drive microbial evolution. Continuous monitoring of microbial communities in space is crucial for understanding their survival, adaptation, and implications for human health during long-duration missions.",
