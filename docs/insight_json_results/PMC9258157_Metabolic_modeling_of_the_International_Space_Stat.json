    "summary_full": "This study investigates the metabolic interactions within the International Space Station (ISS) microbiome, focusing on the dominant bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae. Using computational approaches including graph-theoretical and constraint-based community metabolic modeling, the researchers predicted metabolic dependencies and interactions among various microbes. The findings indicate that K. pneumoniae is beneficial to many coexisting microorganisms, particularly those in the Pantoea genus, and that the Enterobacteriaceae family generally supports microbial survival on the ISS. However, K. pneumoniae also exhibits parasitic interactions with Aspergillus species and amensalistic interactions with Penicillium species. These predictions were experimentally validated by co-culturing K. pneumoniae and Aspergillus fumigatus under normal and simulated microgravity, where K. pneumoniae demonstrated parasitic characteristics, compromising fungal morphology and biofilm formation. The study highlights the complex role of K. pneumoniae in the ISS microbiome and the utility of integrated modeling approaches for understanding such communities.",
