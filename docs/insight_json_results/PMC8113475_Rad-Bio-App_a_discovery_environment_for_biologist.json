    "summary_full": "This paper introduces Rad-Bio-App, a web-accessible database designed to help biologists explore radiation metadata from NASA's GeneLab data repository. Spaceflight exposes organisms to unique ionizing radiation environments that differ significantly from Earth's. Accessing and understanding this complex radiation data has been a challenge, hindering research into its effects on biological systems in space. Rad-Bio-App addresses this by importing radiation metadata and allowing users to visualize, filter, and compare experiments based on radiation exposure and other experimental factors. It integrates data from various sources including spaceflight missions, ground-based simulations, and extraterrestrial measurements (Moon, Mars). The app provides an intuitive, graphically-driven interface for both radiation biologists and non-specialists to understand the impact of space radiation on diverse biological systems. A test case demonstrates its utility in identifying relevant datasets for studying lunar surface radiation effects on biology.",
