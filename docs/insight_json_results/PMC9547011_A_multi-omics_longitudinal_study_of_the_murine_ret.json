    "summary_full": "This study investigated the long-term effects of spaceflight hazards, specifically radiation and simulated microgravity (hindlimb unloading), on the murine retina using a multi-omics approach. Researchers analyzed epigenomic (DNA methylation) and transcriptomic (gene expression) data from mice exposed to these conditions for 21 days, with retinal analysis at 7 days, 1 month, and 4 months post-exposure. They identified thousands of differentially methylated loci/regions and differentially expressed genes, noting that methylation changes correlated most strongly across different conditions at the same time point. Key biological processes affected included nucleotide metabolism, which showed activation at 1 month and suppression at 7 days and 4 months post-exposure. Notch and Wnt signaling pathways were altered 4 months post-exposure. A total of 23 genes exhibited significant changes in both methylation and expression, including those involved in retinal function and inflammation. The study highlights the complex, time-dependent molecular responses of the retina to these spaceflight stressors.",
