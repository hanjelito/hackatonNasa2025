    "document_title": "Genes Required for Survival in Microgravity Revealed by Genome-Wide Yeast Deletion Collections Cultured during Spaceflight",
    "summary_full": "This study utilized molecularly barcoded yeast deletion collections to quantitatively assess the effects of microgravity on cellular fitness. The researchers developed specialized hardware (Opticell Processing Module) to grow both homozygous and heterozygous yeast deletion strains in parallel on the International Space Station and in ground controls, with and without an additional hyperosmolar sodium chloride stress. By comparing the relative abundance of strains after multiple generations, they identified genes crucial for survival under spaceflight conditions. The results indicate that spaceflight significantly impacts RNA metabolism, DNA integrity (repair, replication, chromatin remodeling), and mitochondrial function. The addition of salt stress exacerbated these effects, particularly on RNA and DNA processing. Notably, the gene sensitivity profiles from spaceflight showed high concordance with those induced by DNA-damaging agents and compounds affecting redox state, suggesting these mechanisms are key to microgravity's cellular effects. This work demonstrates the utility of genome-wide screens in spaceflight for understanding fundamental biological responses and has implications for both space biology and terrestrial applications.",

    "conclusions": "Spaceflight induces subtle but significant effects on core cellular processes in yeast, including RNA and ribosomal biogenesis, metabolism, DNA repair and replication, gene expression control, and mitochondrial function. The observed cellular responses strongly implicate DNA and RNA damage, and altered redox states as key mechanisms underlying spaceflight stress, with high concordance to the effects of DNA-damaging agents and compounds affecting redox state. The developed hardware and methodology provide a robust platform for genome-wide environmental screens in space, with potential applications for understanding microbial bioprocessing, alternative fuel development, and basic research.",
