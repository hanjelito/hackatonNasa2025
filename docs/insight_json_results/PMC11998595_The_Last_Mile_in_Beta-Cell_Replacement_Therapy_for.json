    "document_title": "The Last Mile in Beta-Cell Replacement Therapy for Type 1 Diabetes: Time to Grow Up",
    "summary_full": "Beta-cell replacement therapy for type 1 diabetes (T1D) is advancing rapidly due to stem cell biology, gene editing, and tissue engineering. While islet transplantation has shown success, donor scarcity and immune rejection limit its impact. Stem cell-derived beta-like cells offer a promising alternative, with early trials demonstrating functional insulin secretion. However, scaling these therapies for widespread accessibility remains a significant challenge, akin to the difference between space exploration and colonization. The paper argues that without a strategic shift towards scalability, ease of use, and economic feasibility, beta-cell therapy risks becoming an elite intervention. A Quality by Design (QbD) approach is proposed, emphasizing practical implementation from the outset to ensure the therapy progresses from proof-of-concept to a viable, accessible treatment for millions.",

    "conclusions": "Beta-cell replacement therapy for type 1 diabetes has reached a critical juncture where scientific feasibility is demonstrated, but widespread accessibility remains elusive. To overcome the 'last mile' challenges, a paradigm shift is needed, moving beyond academic achievements to prioritize scalability, ease of use, and economic viability. Adopting a Quality by Design approach from the outset is crucial to ensure that these advanced therapies can transition from experimental success to a practical, accessible treatment for the millions affected by T1D.",
