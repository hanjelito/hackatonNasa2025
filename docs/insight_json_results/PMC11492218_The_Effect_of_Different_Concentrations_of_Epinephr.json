    "document_title": "The Effect of Different Concentrations of Epinephrine in Otoendoscopic Surgery on Surgical Field Clarity: A Double-Blind, Randomized Study",
    "summary_full": "This double-blind, randomized controlled trial investigated the optimal concentration of epinephrine/physiological saline for subcutaneous injection into the external auditory canal (EAC) during otoendoscopic surgery under general anesthesia. The study aimed to balance surgical field clarity with hemodynamic stability. 168 patients were randomized into four groups receiving epinephrine concentrations of 1:5000, 1:10,000, 1:20,000, or 1:40,000. Results showed no statistically significant differences in surgical field clarity grade or tympanic membrane flap flipping time among the groups. However, higher epinephrine concentrations (1:5000 and 1:10,000) led to more significant and prolonged increases in hemodynamic parameters (blood pressure, heart rate) compared to lower concentrations (1:20,000 and 1:40,000), which allowed these parameters to return to baseline levels more quickly. The study concluded that while all tested concentrations provide similar surgical field clarity, lower concentrations (1:20,000 to 1:40,000) are preferable due to their minimal impact on patient hemodynamics.",

    "conclusions": "All tested concentrations of topical epinephrine injection in otoendoscopic surgery provide similar surgical field clarity. For optimal patient hemodynamic stability, concentrations ranging from 1:20,000 to 1:40,000 are recommended due to their minimal impact on cardiovascular parameters.",
