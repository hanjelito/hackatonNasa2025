    "summary_full": "This study investigates the impact of varying moisture conditions on the microbiome of dust collected from the International Space Station (ISS). Researchers exposed ISS dust to different levels of relative humidity (RH) and monitored microbial growth and community composition. They found that elevated RH significantly increased fungal growth, with concentrations rising from approximately 4.4 x 10^6 to 2.1 x 10^10 spore equivalents per milligram of dust after 2 weeks at 100% RH. Fungal diversity decreased with increasing moisture. While bacteria could not be modeled using the time-of-wetness framework, their communities also changed with constant RH, showing decreased diversity starting at 85% RH. The study developed a predictive model for fungal growth based on moisture conditions, which can be expanded to include other spaceflight factors like microgravity and radiation. This research is crucial for protecting astronaut health, maintaining spacecraft integrity, and establishing planetary protection protocols for future space exploration.",
