    "summary_full": "This study investigates the functional differences between the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) from E. coli and S. aureus. By creating chimeras between these two proteins, researchers identified that a specific region, particularly a single residue at the periplasmic lipid-aqueous interface of the first transmembrane domain (TM1), significantly influences both the duration the channel stays open (open dwell time) and the tension required to open it (mechanosensitivity). Specifically, E. coli's I49 and S. aureus's F47 were found to be critical. Mutations at this site, especially altering hydrophobicity, demonstrated a strong correlation with channel kinetics and mechanosensitivity, with hydrophobic residues generally leading to longer open dwell times and decreased mechanosensitivity. One mutant exhibited severe hysteresis, indicating altered energy barriers for channel gating. The findings suggest this residue acts like a \"clasp knife spring,\" modulating the resistance for channel opening and closing, and that this mechanism is conserved across MscL orthologues.",

This residue acts as a 'clasp knife spring,' modulating the energy barriers for channel gating. The hydrophobicity and steric properties of this residue, in conjunction with the periplasmic loop, define channel behavior in a manner conserved across different MscL orthologues.",
