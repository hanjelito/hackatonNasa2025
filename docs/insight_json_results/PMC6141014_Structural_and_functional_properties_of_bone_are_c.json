    "document_title": "Structural and functional properties of bone are compromised in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mice",
    "summary_full": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is associated with an increased incidence of skeletal fractures, in addition to muscle weakness. This study investigated the functional, or biomechanical, properties of the skeleton in the SOD1G93A mouse model of ALS, which is known to exhibit decreased bone mass. Researchers examined bone microarchitecture, stiffness, strength, fracture toughness, and cortical bone matrix properties in end-stage SOD1G93A female mice and control littermates. The results showed significantly lower trabecular bone mass, thinner trabeculae, and decreased cortical bone thickness and area in ALS mice. Consequently, these mice exhibited significantly lower femoral bending stiffness and failure moment, along with decreased fracture toughness. The study concludes that the skeleton's functional properties are compromised in end-stage ALS mice, implying multiple mechanisms for increased skeletal fragility and fracture risk in human ALS patients. The findings provide a rationale for interventions to reduce fracture risk in advanced ALS.",

    "conclusions": "This study is the first to demonstrate functional deficits in the skeleton of end-stage ALS SOD1G93A mice, showing reduced femoral bending properties and fracture toughness compared to controls. These findings suggest that skeletal fragility in ALS is likely due to a combination of reduced mechanical loading from muscle atrophy and potentially altered bone cell homeostasis due to the SOD1 mutation. The results underscore the importance of considering skeletal health and fracture prevention strategies for ALS patients, particularly those with advanced disease.",
    "impact_statement": "This research reveals compromised bone strength in ALS mice, highlighting a critical need for interventions to reduce fracture risk in ALS patients, thereby improving their quality of life."
