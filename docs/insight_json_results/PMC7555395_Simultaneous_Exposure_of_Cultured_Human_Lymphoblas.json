    "summary_full": "This study investigated the combined effects of simulated microgravity (μG) and radiation on human lymphoblastic TK6 cells, aiming to assess risks for astronauts during long-term space missions. Cells were exposed to X-ray or carbon ion radiation under simulated μG conditions using a specialized clinostat system. The frequency of chromosome aberrations (CA), indicative of DNA damage, was analyzed. Results showed a significantly higher frequency of both simple and complex CA in cells exposed to radiation simultaneously with simulated μG compared to those exposed to radiation alone. This effect was observed for both X-ray and carbon ion radiation. The findings suggest that current risk assessments based on 1G conditions may underestimate the potential health risks, such as cancer, for astronauts. The study highlights the importance of understanding cellular responses to combined space stressors.",

    "conclusions": "The simultaneous exposure of cultured human lymphoblastic TK6 cells to simulated microgravity and radiation leads to a higher incidence of chromosome aberrations than exposure to radiation alone. This suggests that current risk assessments for astronauts, based on 1G conditions, may underestimate their potential risk for cancer and other health issues. Carbon ion irradiation, particularly, induces more complex chromosome aberrations than X-ray irradiation at equivalent survival doses. Further research is needed using diverse cell types, endpoints, and model systems to fully understand and mitigate the risks associated with combined space stressors.",
    "impact_statement": "This study provides critical evidence that the combined effects of microgravity and space radiation significantly increase DNA damage in cells, necessitating a re-evaluation of astronaut health risk assessments for long-duration space missions."
