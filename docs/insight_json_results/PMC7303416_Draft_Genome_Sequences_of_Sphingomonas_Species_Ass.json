    "summary_full": "This study reports the draft genome sequences of three Sphingomonas strains (two Sphingomonas sanguinis and one Sphingomonas paucimobilis) isolated from the International Space Station (ISS). The genomes were assembled using SPAdes and annotated with the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline. The sequencing and assembly process involved DNA extraction, library preparation using the Nextera Flex protocol, and whole-genome shotgun sequencing on a NovaSeq 6000. The generated genomic data will facilitate comparative analyses with Earth-based counterparts to understand the influence of microgravity and radiation on their characteristics, such as bioactive compound production and biofilm formation. The raw data and genome sequences are publicly available.",
