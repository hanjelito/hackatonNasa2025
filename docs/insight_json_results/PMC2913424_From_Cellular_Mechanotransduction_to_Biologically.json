    "summary_full": "This article reviews over thirty years of research on cellular mechanotransduction, focusing on the tensegrity model of cell structure. Initially trained as a cell biologist, the author found engineering tools necessary to test theories about how cells use tensegrity architecture to stabilize shape and sense mechanical signals. This interdisciplinary approach confirmed the critical role of physical forces in cell function and development, leading to the discovery of how cells sense and respond to mechanical signals at the molecular level. Key findings include the validation of the tensegrity model for cell mechanics, the central role of integrins and the cytoskeleton in mechanosensing, and the development of technologies such as micromagnetic actuators, microfluidic devices for sepsis therapy, and DNA-based nanobiotechnology for biomimetic materials.",
