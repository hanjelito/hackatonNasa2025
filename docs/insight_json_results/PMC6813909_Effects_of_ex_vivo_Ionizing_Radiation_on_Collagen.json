    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of ex vivo ionizing radiation on mouse lumbar vertebrae to understand how radiation impacts bone brittleness. Vertebrae were exposed to doses ranging from 50 Gy (radiotherapy) to 35,000 Gy (sterilization). The researchers measured collagen fragmentation, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking, and mechanical properties (monotonic and cyclic compression). They found that significant reductions in bone strength and fatigue life occurred at doses of 17,000 Gy and above, which correlated with increased collagen fragmentation. Conversely, while non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking increased at all radiation doses, it did not correlate with the observed mechanical degradation. The study concludes that collagen fragmentation, rather than non-enzymatic crosslinking, is the primary cause of radiation-induced bone embrittlement.",

    "conclusions": "Ex vivo ionizing radiation at doses relevant to bone allograft sterilization (17,000 Gy and above) significantly reduces the compressive strength and fatigue life of mouse vertebrae. This degradation is primarily caused by the fragmentation of the collagen backbone, rather than the increase in non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks, which occurs at all tested radiation doses.",
    "impact_statement": "This study clarifies the molecular mechanisms behind radiation-induced bone embrittlement, informing safer sterilization practices for bone allografts and potentially guiding the development of radioprotective strategies."
