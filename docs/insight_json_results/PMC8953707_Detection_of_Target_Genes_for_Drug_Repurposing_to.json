    "summary_full": "This study investigates skeletal muscle atrophy, a condition exacerbated by aging, diabetes, and spaceflight microgravity. The researchers employed multi-modal gene disease and disease drug networks, utilizing link prediction algorithms to identify drugs for repurposing. Transcriptomic datasets from mice flown in spaceflight, obtained from NASA's GeneLab, were analyzed using graph theoretic network analysis to detect key target genes responsible for muscle atrophy in various leg muscles. Machine learning methods, including Pearson correlation and Bayesian Markov blanket, identified top gene regulators. Knowledge graphs were constructed using the Scalable Precision Medicine Knowledge Engine. Graph convolutional networks (GCNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), random forest, and gradient boosting were trained to predict links and rank gene-disease associations. The GCN method demonstrated superior performance in link prediction. Key genes identified were linked to metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. The repurposed drugs suggested by the GCN method include nutrients, corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory medications, and insulin-related drugs.",
