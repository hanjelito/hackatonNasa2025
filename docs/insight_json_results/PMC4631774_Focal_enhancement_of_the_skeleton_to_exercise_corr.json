    "summary_full": "This study investigated the relationship between bone adaptation to exercise and the responsivity of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in growing mice. Contrary to the expectation that higher external forces lead to greater bone adaptation, the study found that skeletal effects of exercise were site-specific and not directly correlated with peak external forces. Forelimbs, which generated higher forces during locomotion, showed no significant augmentation in diaphyseal structure. In contrast, the ulna, femur, and tibia showed significant enhancements in diaphyseal bone areas and moments of area, with the femur and tibia also showing improved trabecular structure. Furthermore, MSCs in the femur were more responsive to exercise-induced loads, with running significantly lowering MSC populations in the femur but not the humerus. These findings suggest that the capacity of progenitor cells to differentiate into bone-forming cells may be a better predictor of bone structural adaptation to exercise than the magnitude of external forces.",

    "conclusions": "Skeletal adaptation to exercise is site-specific and appears to be more closely related to the responsivity of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to mechanical loading than to the magnitude of peak external forces. The differential response of MSCs between skeletal sites, such as the femur versus the humerus, may explain why some bones adapt to exercise while others do not, even when subjected to similar or higher external loads. This suggests that the cellular capacity for osteogenesis, rather than just the mechanical demand, plays a crucial role in bone's adaptive response.",
    "impact_statement": "This study challenges the long-held assumption that bone adaptation to exercise is solely driven by the magnitude of external forces, suggesting that the responsiveness of progenitor cells is a key factor, with implications for designing targeted exercise therapies and interpreting fossil evidence of physical activity."
