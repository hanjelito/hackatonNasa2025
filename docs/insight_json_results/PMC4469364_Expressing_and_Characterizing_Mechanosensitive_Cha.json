    "summary_full": "This paper details the methods for heterologous expression and characterization of bacterial and plant mechanosensitive ion channels (MSCs) in Xenopus laevis oocytes. While Xenopus oocytes are a common system for expressing various membrane proteins, their application for studying MSCs has been less explored, partly due to endogenous MSC activity. The protocol outlines procedures for frog surgery, oocyte isolation, in vitro RNA production and injection, and electrophysiological characterization using patch-clamp and pressure-clamp techniques. It addresses challenges such as endogenous channel activity and provides detailed steps for preparing oocytes, injecting them with cRNA, and recording single-channel currents under controlled pressure and voltage conditions. The aim is to provide a comprehensive guide for researchers interested in using the Xenopus oocyte system for MSC studies.",
