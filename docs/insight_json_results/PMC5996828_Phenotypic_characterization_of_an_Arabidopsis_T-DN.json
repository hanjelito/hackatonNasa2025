    "summary_full": "This study reports the identification and characterization of a T-DNA insertion line, SALK_063500, in the Arabidopsis thaliana gene At1G05290. The insertion was found within exon one, and homozygous T-DNA alleles were unattainable, indicating a homozygous lethal phenotype. In heterozygous SALK_063500 plants, At1G05290 expression levels were reduced compared to wild-type (Col-0). These heterozygous plants exhibited an aberrant silique phenotype, characterized by reduced silique length and seed fill, which was attributed to a reduced rate of pollen tube germination, both in vitro and in vivo. The data suggest that At1G05290 plays a crucial role in pollen development and male fertility in Arabidopsis.",

    "conclusions": "The T-DNA insertion in the At1G05290 gene of the SALK_063500 line leads to a homozygous lethal phenotype and reduced gene expression in heterozygotes. This reduction in At1G05290 expression causes an aberrant silique phenotype and impaired pollen tube germination, highlighting the gene's critical role in pollen development and male fertility in Arabidopsis.",
