    "summary_full": "This study investigates the molecular basis of skin changes observed during spaceflight by analyzing skin biopsies from the Inspiration4 crew before and after a short-duration mission. Using multi-omics approaches including spatial transcriptomics, single-cell RNA/ATAC-seq, and metagenomics, the researchers examined gene expression, microbial, and immune changes across different skin compartments. Post-flight samples showed significant upregulation of genes related to inflammation and KRAS signaling, alongside disruptions in epithelial barrier function, DNA damage, and altered immune cell responses, particularly in the outer skin layers. These molecular changes were linked to shifts in skin microbiota and immune cell activity. The findings provide the first comprehensive spatial multi-omics analysis of astronaut skin, offering insights into spaceflight-induced skin alterations and potential countermeasures.",

    "conclusions": "Short-duration spaceflight induces significant molecular and cellular changes in human skin, characterized by increased inflammation and KRAS signaling, epithelial barrier disruption, DNA damage, and altered immune responses. These changes are spatially resolved across skin layers and are associated with shifts in the skin microbiome. The findings highlight the skin's sensitivity to spaceflight stressors and provide a foundation for developing countermeasures to protect astronaut skin health.",
    "impact_statement": "This study provides the first detailed spatial multi-omics map of human skin changes due to spaceflight, revealing key molecular pathways and cellular responses that are critical for understanding astronaut health and developing protective strategies for future missions."
