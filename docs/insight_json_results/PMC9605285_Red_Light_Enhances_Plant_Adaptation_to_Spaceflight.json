    "summary_full": "This study investigates how plants adapt to spaceflight conditions, focusing on the role of light, particularly red light, in mitigating the negative effects of microgravity and partial gravity (Mars-g). Experiments on the ISS revealed that red light partially reverses gene reprogramming induced by microgravity, suggesting it can help plants cope with space environments. Transcriptomic analysis showed that microgravity leads to elevated plastid and mitochondrial gene expression and disturbed nucleus-organelle communication, while Mars-g activates stress response pathways and acclimation-related transcription factors. The study also explored the role of nucleolin mutants, finding that some mutants exhibit differential responses to red light, opening possibilities for directed mutagenesis in crop design for space colonization. The findings suggest that specific light conditions, like red light, can be used to improve plant adaptation and growth in extraterrestrial environments.",

    "conclusions": "The SEEDLING GROWTH experiments demonstrate that red light illumination can partially revert microgravity-induced gene reprogramming and mitigate adverse effects of altered gravity on plant development. Mars gravity levels can induce adaptive responses, including stress hormone pathway activation and acclimation factor upregulation, which are further enhanced by red light. The differential responses of nucleolin mutants suggest a role for directed mutagenesis in developing crops for space colonization. Future research should incorporate radiation effects and focus on crop species, utilizing facilities that allow for comparative studies across different gravity levels.",
    "impact_statement": "This research provides crucial insights into optimizing plant growth in space by utilizing light as a countermeasure to microgravity, paving the way for sustainable agriculture in future space exploration and colonization."
