    "summary_full": "This document is a correction to a previously published paper in the journal Life. The correction pertains to Figure 10, specifically a bar graph within the figure. The authors state that the wrong legend version was uploaded, mistakenly using 'Fer' for ferritin instead of 'Tf' for transferrin. This error made the graph nonsensical as the section focuses on transferrin (Tf) and GPDH. The authors confirm that swapping the legend will correct the information without altering the underlying data, content, or caption. The corrected figure and its caption are provided, detailing the expression of Tf and GPDH in GC-OLPs and SPC-OLPs. The authors assert that this correction does not affect the scientific conclusions of the original paper.",
