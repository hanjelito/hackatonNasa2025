    "summary_full": "This study performed a meta-analysis of 15 Arabidopsis thaliana spaceflight transcriptomic experiments from NASA's GeneLab data repository. By reanalyzing data using a common computational pipeline and cross-referencing extensive metadata, the researchers aimed to identify robust plant responses to spaceflight. The analysis revealed that experimental factors such as assay type (microarray vs. RNA-seq) and environmental/hardware conditions significantly confound comparisons of spaceflight effects. By filtering studies based on metadata similarity, more reliable conclusions could be drawn. Key findings include conserved responses related to stress, photosynthesis, and primary/secondary metabolism. Targeted analysis of experiments using the Biological Research in Canister (BRIC) hardware highlighted the plastid as a likely response site and identified conserved roles for HSP101 and COR78, suggesting disruptions in ROS and antioxidant systems. The study emphasizes the importance of standardized analysis and careful metadata consideration for robust interpretation of spaceflight omics data.",
