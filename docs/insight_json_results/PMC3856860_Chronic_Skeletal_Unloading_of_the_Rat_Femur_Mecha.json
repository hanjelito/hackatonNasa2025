    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of chronic skeletal unloading on femoral bone and marrow blood flow and vascular resistance in rats, and whether these changes are linked to structural remodeling of the principal nutrient artery (PNA). Rats were subjected to 7 or 14 days of hindlimb unloading (HU) or served as controls. Blood flow and vascular resistance were measured during a 10-minute reloading period. PNA structure (diameter and wall thickness) was also analyzed. Results showed that chronic HU reduced femoral perfusion and increased vascular resistance during reloading. This was associated with a remodeling of the PNA, characterized by a smaller intraluminal diameter and thinner medial wall in HU rats. These structural changes appear to normalize mechanical stresses (shear and circumferential wall stress) within the PNA during unloading but may limit blood flow capacity upon reloading, potentially contributing to bone ischemia.",

    "conclusions": "Chronic skeletal unloading impairs the ability of the femur's vasculature to increase blood flow and nutrient delivery to bone and marrow upon immediate acute reloading. This impairment is due to structural remodeling of the bone resistance vasculature, specifically the principal nutrient artery, which reduces its diameter and wall thickness. While this remodeling helps maintain mechanical homeostasis within the artery during unloading, it may limit blood flow capacity during reloading, potentially contributing to bone ischemia.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals that skeletal unloading causes detrimental vascular remodeling in bone, which could compromise bone health and nutrient supply during periods of activity or reloading."
