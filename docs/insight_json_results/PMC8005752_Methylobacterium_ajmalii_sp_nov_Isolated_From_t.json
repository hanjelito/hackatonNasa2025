    "document_title": "Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov., Isolated From the International Space Station",
    "summary_full": "This study describes the isolation and characterization of three novel bacterial strains, designated IF7SW-B2T, IIF1SW-B5, and IIF4SW-B5, from various locations on the International Space Station (ISS). These strains, along with a fourth identified as Methylorubrum rhodesianum, belong to the family Methylobacteriaceae. Through polyphasic taxonomic analyses, including 16S rRNA gene sequencing, multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA), average nucleotide identity (ANI), and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH), the three ISS strains were confirmed to represent a new species within the genus Methylobacterium. They were phenotypically characterized and found to grow optimally at 25-30°C and pH 6.0-8.0, with limited salt tolerance. Genomic analysis revealed the presence of genes associated with nitrogen metabolism, stress response, and plant growth promotion, including cytokinin production and cobalamin synthesis. The proposed name for this new species is Methylobacterium ajmalii sp. nov., with IF7SW-B2T as the type strain. The findings highlight the presence of diverse microbial life in the ISS environment and suggest potential biotechnological applications for these space-isolated bacteria.",
