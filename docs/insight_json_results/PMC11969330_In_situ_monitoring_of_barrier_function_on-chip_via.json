    "summary_full": "This paper introduces a novel fiber optic-based sensing platform for automated, non-invasive, and real-time monitoring of barrier function in organs-on-a-chip (OOCs). The platform addresses the limitations of current characterization methods, which often require manual intervention and yield only endpoint data. The system uses fiber optics to deliver excitation light and collect emitted luminescence from on-chip cultures, enabling continuous tracking of paracellular transport. It was validated using Caco-2 epithelial and HUVEC endothelial cell models under induced inflammation, demonstrating its ability to detect changes in barrier integrity with high temporal resolution. The platform also showed versatility in multiplexed sensing, allowing for simultaneous measurement of different fluorescently labeled dextrans to assess size- and charge-dependent transport. This technology offers a more efficient and robust approach for characterizing OOCs, potentially accelerating their adoption in drug development and disease modeling.",
