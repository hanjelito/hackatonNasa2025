    "summary_full": "This commentary highlights NASA's commitment to Open Science, particularly through the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR), which makes invaluable space-related biological and biomedical data accessible to the public. OSDR standardizes data from various model organisms and human astronauts, covering 'omics, phenotypic, physiological, and behavioral changes. The repository supports advanced analytics, including AI, and has been developed with community input. NASA's 'Transform to Open Science' (TOPS) program aims to train scientists in Open Science practices and promote equity. The OSDR system ensures data is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). A recent Nature portfolio Collection, \"The Second Space Age: Omics, Platforms, and Medicine Across Orbits,\" showcases the utility of OSDR data, including contributions from the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission. The commentary also references related work on AI in deep space research and the integration of Open Science principles with the Human Research Program, emphasizing the terrestrial benefits of space biology insights.",
