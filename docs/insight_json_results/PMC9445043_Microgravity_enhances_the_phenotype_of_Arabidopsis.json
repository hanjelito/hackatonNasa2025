    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of microgravity on plant vacuole fusion using the Arabidopsis zigzag-1 (zig-1) mutant, which has fragmented vacuoles. The researchers developed a formaldehyde-based fixation protocol compatible with spaceflight hardware (BRIC-PDFU) to visualize vacuole morphology after sample return from the International Space Station (ISS). They found that microgravity enhanced the zig-1 phenotype, leading to reduced hypocotyl growth and a mild decrease in vacuole fusion in some root cells, particularly in the epidermis. The study also demonstrated the feasibility of using chemical inhibitor treatments, like Wortmannin (WM), for plant cell biology experiments in space, although limitations in hardware precision affected fixation quality. Amyloplasts remained associated with the tonoplast in microgravity, and their distribution shifted in WT seedlings.",
