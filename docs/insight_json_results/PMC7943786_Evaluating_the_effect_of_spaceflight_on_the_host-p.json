    "summary_full": "This study investigated the impact of spaceflight on the interaction between human intestinal epithelial cells (HT-29) and Salmonella Typhimurium, marking the first in-flight infection and dual RNA-seq analysis using human cells. Both host and pathogen were simultaneously exposed to spaceflight conditions aboard the STS-131 mission. Uninfected flight cultures showed altered gene expression compared to ground controls, with upregulation of genes related to interferon signaling and differentiation, and downregulation of metabolic pathways. Upon Salmonella infection, both flight and ground cultures exhibited common pro-inflammatory responses. However, spaceflight also induced unique host transcriptional and proteomic responses, suggesting a potentially heightened host response to infection during spaceflight, characterized by amplified induction of pro-inflammatory mediators and wound healing genes. Bacterial gene expression analysis revealed upregulation of metabolic pathways and virulence regulators in flight conditions. The findings highlight spaceflight's influence on host-pathogen dynamics and underscore the need for further research into infectious disease risks during space missions.",

    "conclusions": "Spaceflight significantly alters the host-pathogen interaction between human intestinal epithelial cells and Salmonella Typhimurium. While a core inflammatory response to Salmonella is conserved between spaceflight and ground conditions, spaceflight induces unique host transcriptional and proteomic changes, suggesting a potentially amplified host response to infection. These findings have implications for understanding infectious disease risks during space missions and for developing countermeasures.",
