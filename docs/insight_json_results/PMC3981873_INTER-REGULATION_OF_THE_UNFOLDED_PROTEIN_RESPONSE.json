    "summary_full": "This study investigates the connection between the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular stress response originating in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and auxin signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana. The researchers found that ER stress, induced by tunicamycin, leads to the down-regulation of auxin sensors (TIR1/AFBs) and transporters (PINs) in plants. Conversely, mutations in ER-localized auxin transporters (PIN5, PIN6, PILS) compromise UPR activation. The study also demonstrates that the ER stress sensor IRE1 is crucial for proper auxin response and homeostasis, as ire1 mutants show defects in auxin sensitivity and reduced free auxin levels. Furthermore, a triple mutant (ire1 pin5) exhibited enhanced defects in both auxin response and UPR activation compared to single mutants. These findings suggest that plants have evolved a hormone-dependent strategy, involving ER-based auxin regulation, to coordinate ER function with physiological processes and maintain a balance between stress adaptation and growth.",

    "conclusions": "The study establishes a significant inter-regulation between the unfolded protein response (UPR) and auxin signaling in Arabidopsis. ER stress negatively impacts auxin signaling by down-regulating auxin regulators, while ER-based auxin homeostasis is crucial for optimal UPR activation. The ER stress sensor IRE1 plays a vital role in mediating auxin responses and maintaining auxin homeostasis. These findings reveal a plant-specific strategy where the UPR has evolved to integrate with hormonal signaling, particularly auxin, to coordinate ER function with physiological processes, thereby balancing stress adaptation and growth.",
