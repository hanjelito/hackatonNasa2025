    "summary_full": "This study describes two novel yeast species, Naganishia kalamii and Cystobasidium onofrii, isolated from NASA cleanrooms used for Mars 2020 mission assembly. Using a polyphasic taxonomic approach including morphology, multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA), and whole genome sequencing (WGS), the researchers confirmed these as new species. Genomic analysis revealed genes associated with dehydration, desiccation, osmotolerance, and psychrotolerance. Both novel species demonstrated UV-C resistance, comparable to the extremophilic yeast Naganishia onofrii. The findings highlight the importance of characterizing extremotolerant microbes for improving NASA's planetary protection protocols and understanding potential contamination risks for future space missions.",
