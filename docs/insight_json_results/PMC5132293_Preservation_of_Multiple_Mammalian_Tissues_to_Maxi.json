    "summary_full": "This study aimed to optimize tissue preservation methods for rodent experiments, particularly for spaceflight, to maximize scientific return. Researchers investigated the impact of post-euthanasia harvest time, preservation methods (RNAlater and freezing), and storage duration at -80°C on RNA quality (measured by RIN) and enzyme activity in liver and spleen. They also explored dissecting tissues from frozen carcasses. Results showed that fresh tissues stored up to 11 months at -80°C had minimal impact on RNA quality. Spleens preserved in RNAlater maintained high RNA quality even when collected up to 100 minutes post-euthanasia. Liver RNA quality declined after 65 minutes. Tissues dissected from frozen carcasses showed variable results; liver, heart, and kidneys retained good RNA quality after 6-7 months, while small intestine, bone, and bone marrow degraded significantly. The study concludes that protocols for on-orbit dissections can yield high-quality samples despite delayed preservation, and that many tissues can be recovered from frozen carcasses for gene expression analysis.",

    "conclusions": "High-quality RNA can be obtained from most mammalian tissues even with delayed preservation post-euthanasia (up to 1 hour for spleen, up to 65 minutes for liver) and prolonged storage at -80°C (up to 11 months). Tissues dissected from frozen carcasses can also yield high-quality RNA for gene expression analysis, although this varies by tissue type. These findings support the feasibility of collecting valuable biological samples from both ground-based and spaceflight experiments under resource-constrained conditions.",
    "impact_statement": "This study provides crucial protocols for preserving mammalian tissues, enabling high-quality molecular analysis from challenging experimental conditions like spaceflight and resource-limited ground studies."
