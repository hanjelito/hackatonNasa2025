    "document_title": "NASA open science data repository: open science for life in space",
    "summary_full": "This paper describes the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR), a consolidated platform integrating the Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) and GeneLab. Launched in 2021, OSDR enhances access to a wide range of life sciences, biomedical-clinical, and mission telemetry data, alongside existing 'omics data. The repository features a biological data management environment (BDME) for improved data submission, a new user interface, controlled data access for sensitive information, an enhanced API, and public visualization tools for environmental telemetry, radiation dosimetry, and 'omics analyses. OSDR aims to foster global collaboration through analysis working groups and training programs, promoting transparency and inclusivity in space biology research to advance understanding of spaceflight's impact on biological systems and support future deep space missions.",
