    "summary_full": "Ionizing radiation, encountered by radiotherapy patients, radiation workers, and astronauts, can cause bone loss by increasing oxidative damage and promoting bone-resorbing osteoclasts. This study investigated the efficacy of various interventions, including an antioxidant cocktail, dihydrolipoic acid, ibuprofen, and dried plum (DP), in mitigating radiation-induced bone loss. Mice were exposed to gamma rays (2 Gy) or simulated space radiation (1 Gy protons and heavy ions). The DP diet was found to be the most effective intervention, significantly reducing the expression of genes related to bone resorption (Nfe2l2, Rankl, Mcp1, Opg, TNF-α) and preventing cancellous bone loss in both radiation models. Other interventions showed partial or no protective effects. The findings suggest that dietary supplementation with dried plum may be a viable strategy to prevent skeletal damage from radiation exposure.",

    "conclusions": "Dietary supplementation with dried plum effectively prevents bone loss and preserves skeletal microarchitecture following exposure to both gamma radiation and simulated space radiation. This protective effect is associated with the mitigation of radiation-induced increases in pro-osteoclastogenic and oxidative stress-related gene expression in bone marrow cells.",
    "impact_statement": "This study identifies dried plum as a promising dietary intervention to protect against bone loss caused by ionizing radiation, relevant for astronauts, radiotherapy patients, and radiation workers."
