    "summary_full": "This review examines the impact of space environmental factors, specifically microgravity and space radiation, on DNA integrity and the DNA damage response (DDR) in living organisms. Space radiation can directly or indirectly damage DNA, while microgravity may impair DNA repair mechanisms, leading to an accumulation of lesions like double-strand breaks, chromosome aberrations, and mutations, which increase cancer risk. Studies using ground-based analogs and actual spaceflight experiments have yielded conflicting results regarding the synergistic effects of microgravity and radiation on DNA damage and repair. While some simulated microgravity studies suggest altered DDR and increased sensitivity to radiation, most in-space experiments have shown no significant impact of microgravity on DNA repair capacity. The review concludes that further experiments in the true space environment are necessary to definitively address these critical questions and understand the complex interplay of various spaceflight factors on DNA integrity and cellular repair.",

    "conclusions": "Space environmental factors, including radiation and microgravity, can damage DNA. While ground-based studies suggest microgravity can impair DNA repair and increase sensitivity to radiation, experiments conducted in actual spaceflight have yielded conflicting results, with many showing no significant impact of microgravity on DNA repair. The complexity of space radiation and the potential influence of other environmental factors necessitate further carefully designed experiments in space to accurately assess DNA damage and the DNA damage response, and to understand their implications for human health.",
    "impact_statement": "This review highlights the critical need for further research into the combined effects of space radiation and microgravity on DNA integrity, which is essential for ensuring astronaut health during long-duration space missions."
