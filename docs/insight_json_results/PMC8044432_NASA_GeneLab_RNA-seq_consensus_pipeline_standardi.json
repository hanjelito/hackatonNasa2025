    "document_title": "NASA GeneLab RNA-seq consensus pipeline: standardized processing of short-read RNA-seq data",
    "summary_full": "This paper describes the NASA GeneLab RNA-seq Consensus Pipeline (RCP), a standardized workflow for analyzing short-read RNA sequencing data from spaceflight-related experiments. The pipeline addresses the challenges of data variability in spaceflight research by implementing consistent quality control, read trimming, mapping, and gene quantification steps. It utilizes tools such as FastQC, MultiQC, TrimGalore, STAR, RSEM, and DESeq2. The processed data and the pipeline details are made publicly available through the GeneLab database to promote transparency, reproducibility, and reusability of spaceflight omics data. The goal is to provide a template for future datasets and enable cross-analysis with other databases.",
