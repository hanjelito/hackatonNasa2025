    "summary_full": "This study investigates the protein-protein interactions between the S1 helix and the TM2 cytoplasmic interface (TM2ci) regions of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) and how these interactions change during channel gating. Using an in vivo disulfide trapping assay with 143 double-cysteine mutants, the researchers mapped these interactions. They found that mutations leading to disulfide bridging between S1 and TM2ci either locked the channel in a closed state or stabilized it in a sub-conductive state, depending on the specific residues involved. Patch clamp experiments confirmed these findings, showing differential channel activity under varying redox potentials. The results support a model where the S1 helix acts as a stabilizer for TM1 and interacts dynamically with TM2ci during MscL gating, consistent with TM2 tilting within the membrane.",

    "conclusions": "The study successfully mapped protein-protein interactions between the S1 and TM2ci domains of MscL, revealing that these interactions are crucial for channel gating. Specific disulfide bridges can lock the channel in closed or sub-conductive states, supporting a dynamic model where S1 acts as a stabilizer and interacts with TM2ci during the conformational changes associated with gating.",
