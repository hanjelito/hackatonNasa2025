    "summary_full": "This protocol describes a method to visualize calcium (Ca2+) signaling in real-time within living Arabidopsis plants during feeding by hemipteran pests, specifically the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae). By expressing a GFP-based calcium biosensor (GCaMP3) in Arabidopsis, researchers can use fluorescence microscopy to observe cytosolic calcium dynamics with high spatial and temporal resolution. The assay involves using detached leaves from GCaMP3-expressing plants, allowing for continuous measurement of calcium signals before, during, and after aphid feeding. The results show a rapid, highly localized elevation of calcium around the aphid feeding site within minutes, while systemic signals are not detected. This method offers a robust and repeatable way to study plant responses to biotic stress, distinct from wounding responses, and can be adapted for other insect species or biotic stresses. The use of Arabidopsis facilitates further molecular analysis through its genetic resources.",
