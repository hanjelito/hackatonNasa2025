    "summary_full": "This study investigates the role of the exocyst complex, specifically the EXO70A1 subunit, in the delivery of proteins to the plasma membrane in Arabidopsis roots. Using the inhibitor Endosidin2 (ES2) and quantitative proteomics, researchers identified 145 plasma membrane proteins whose abundance was significantly reduced after short-term ES2 treatment. These proteins are involved in diverse functions including cell growth, cell wall biosynthesis, hormone signaling, stress response, and nutrient uptake, suggesting the exocyst complex mediates the constitutive transport of a broad range of proteins. Live imaging confirmed the reduced plasma membrane abundance of candidate proteins like PIN2 and BRI1. The study also observed that ES2 treatment disrupted the polarized distribution of EXO70A1 at the plasma membrane. The findings indicate that the exocyst complex is crucial for dynamic protein transport to the plasma membrane, essential for normal root growth and adaptation.",
