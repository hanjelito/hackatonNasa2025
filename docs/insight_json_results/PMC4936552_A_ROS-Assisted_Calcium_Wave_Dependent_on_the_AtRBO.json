    "summary_full": "This study investigates the mechanism behind systemic signaling in plants, specifically the calcium (Ca2+) wave that propagates throughout the plant in response to localized salt stress. Using mathematical modeling and experimental data, the researchers found that a simple calcium-induced calcium-release (CICR) mechanism involving the TPC1 cation channel is insufficient to explain the observed wave speeds. Instead, they propose a ROS-assisted CICR mechanism where reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced by the NADPH oxidase AtRBOHD, play a crucial role in propagating the Ca2+ wave. Experiments involving ROS scavengers, NADPH oxidase inhibitors, and AtrbohD knockout mutants showed reduced Ca2+ wave transmission speeds, supporting this model. Direct imaging of extracellular ROS production also revealed a systemic spread dependent on both AtRBOHD and TPC1. The findings suggest that this ROS-assisted mechanism, involving AtRBOHD and TPC1, is essential for propagating systemic stress signals in plants.",

    "conclusions": "The study concludes that the systemic response to salt stress in plants is propagated by a ROS-assisted calcium-induced calcium-release (CICR) mechanism. This mechanism involves the NADPH oxidase AtRBOHD for ROS production and the TPC1 cation channel for Ca2+ release from the vacuole. While a simple CICR mechanism is insufficient, the integration of ROS signaling with Ca2+ signaling allows for the rapid and efficient propagation of stress signals throughout the plant, primarily through root cortical and endodermal cells.",
