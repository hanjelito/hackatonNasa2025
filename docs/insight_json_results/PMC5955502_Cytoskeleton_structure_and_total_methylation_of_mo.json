    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of a 37-day space flight on cytoskeletal protein and mRNA expression in mouse cardiac and lung tissues. Unlike previous studies where samples were collected after landing, this experiment allowed for sample fixation under actual spaceflight conditions, avoiding readaptation effects. The results showed no significant changes in cytoskeletal protein content in either tissue. However, significant alterations were observed in the mRNA expression levels of genes encoding cytoskeletal proteins. Furthermore, the study found an increase in total DNA methylation in both cardiac and lung tissues of the space-flown mice. While the expression of most transcriptional regulators remained unchanged, a significant decrease in Tet2 mRNA (a DNA demethylase) was observed, suggesting a potential mechanism for the observed hypermethylation. The authors conclude that long-duration space flight may lead to adaptation of the cytoskeletal protein pattern to weightlessness, with potential epigenetic modifications like increased DNA methylation playing a role in regulating gene expression.",

    "conclusions": "Long-duration space flight did not alter cytoskeletal protein content in mouse cardiac and lung tissues, but it did induce significant changes in mRNA expression levels and an increase in total genome methylation. The decrease in Tet2 mRNA suggests a potential mechanism for the observed hypermethylation, which may contribute to the altered gene expression patterns.",
    "impact_statement": "This study provides critical insights into the epigenetic and molecular adaptations of mammalian tissues to spaceflight by enabling sample collection under microgravity, highlighting potential targets for mitigating health risks during long-duration space missions."
