    "summary_full": "This review explores the multifaceted role of microbes in enabling sustainable human space exploration beyond low Earth orbit, focusing on upcoming missions to the Moon and Mars. It highlights how microbes can be leveraged for bioregenerative life support systems (BLSS), including plant cultivation, water recycling, waste bioconversion, and atmosphere revitalization. The paper also discusses their application in biological in situ resource utilization (bISRU), such as generating electricity via microbial fuel cells and extracting metals through biomining. Furthermore, it examines the potential of bioengineered microbes for producing pharmaceuticals, acting as biosensors, and creating novel biomaterials for construction and manufacturing. While acknowledging the benefits, the review also addresses the negative impacts of microbes, such as increased pathogenicity and biofilm formation, and proposes mitigation strategies. Ultimately, understanding and harnessing microbial capabilities are presented as crucial for ensuring the success and sustainability of long-duration space missions and extraterrestrial habitats.",
