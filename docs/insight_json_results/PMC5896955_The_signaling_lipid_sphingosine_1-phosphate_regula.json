    "summary_full": "This study investigates the role of the bioactive lipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and its receptor S1P Receptor 3 (S1PR3) in regulating mechanical pain. Researchers found that genetic or pharmacological disruption of S1PR3, or inhibition of S1P production, significantly impaired behavioral responses to noxious mechanical stimuli in mice, without affecting responses to innocuous touch or thermal stimuli. These effects are mediated by A mechanonociceptors (AMs), which showed decreased mechanosensitivity in S1PR3 mutant mice. The study further demonstrates that S1PR3 signaling tunes AM excitability by modulating KCNQ2/3 channels. The findings establish S1P/S1PR3 signaling as a critical regulator of mechanical pain thresholds.",

    "conclusions": "The study concludes that sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) signaling through S1P Receptor 3 (S1PR3) is essential for setting normal mechanical pain thresholds by modulating the excitability of A mechanonociceptors (AMs) via KCNQ2/3 channels. While baseline S1P levels are crucial for acute mechanical pain, elevated S1P levels, as seen during inflammation, primarily contribute to thermal hypersensitivity. S1PR3 is thus identified as a novel and promising therapeutic target for mechanical pain.",
