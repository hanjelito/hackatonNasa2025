    "summary_full": "This study identifies and characterizes HYPERSENSITIVE TO LATRUNCULIN B1 (HLB1), a plant-specific tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain-containing protein in Arabidopsis thaliana. HLB1 was identified through a forward-genetic screen for mutants hypersensitive to the actin-disrupting drug latrunculin B (LatB). HLB1 localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN)/early endosome (EE) and associates with the actin cytoskeleton. It interacts with MIN7/BEN1, an ADP-ribosylation factor guanine nucleotide exchange factor (ARF-GEF), and the min7/ben1 mutant exhibits similar phenotypes to hlb1, suggesting they function in common genetic pathways. HLB1 plays a role in post-Golgi traffic, specifically in protein recycling to the plasma membrane and potentially in constitutive secretion and vacuolar trafficking. The C-terminal domain of HLB1 is crucial for its TGN/EE localization, and the protein tracks along actin filaments, suggesting a link between post-Golgi traffic and the actin cytoskeleton. The findings highlight HLB1 as a novel component of the plant endomembrane trafficking machinery, conserved in land plants.",
