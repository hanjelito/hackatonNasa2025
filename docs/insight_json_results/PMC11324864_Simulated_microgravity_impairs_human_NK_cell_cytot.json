    "summary_full": "This study investigated the impact of simulated microgravity (sμG) on the cytotoxic activity of human Natural Killer (NK) cells against leukemic cells, relevant to cancer risk in astronauts exposed to space radiation. NK cells were cultured for 48 hours under normal gravity and sμG. Cytotoxicity assays were performed using standard methods and under continuous sμG. Results showed that sμG significantly reduced NK cell cytotoxicity against both chronic myeloid leukemia (K-562) and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (MOLT-4) cells. These inhibitory effects were more pronounced when the cytotoxicity assay was conducted under continuous sμG. RNA sequencing revealed alterations in gene expression pathways in NK cells exposed to sμG, including the induction of genes associated with impaired cytotoxicity (e.g., CD1 isoforms, CD5, CD55, CD47) and downregulation of activating receptors. The findings suggest that microgravity may increase astronaut risk of leukemogenesis, particularly for T-ALL, due to combined effects with space radiation. The study highlights the need for countermeasures to mitigate these immune deficits during long-duration space missions.",

    "conclusions": "Simulated microgravity significantly impairs human NK cell cytotoxic activity against leukemic cells, with effects being more pronounced under continuous microgravity conditions. These findings, particularly the reduced cytotoxicity against T-ALL cells, raise concerns about increased astronaut risk of leukemogenesis during prolonged space missions due to the combined effects of microgravity and space radiation. RNA-seq data provide mechanistic insights into these deficits, suggesting potential targets for countermeasures.",
