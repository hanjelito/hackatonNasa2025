    "summary_full": "This review explores the formation and repair of plasma membrane disruptions (PMD) in mammalian cells, a crucial mechanism for detecting and responding to mechanical loading. PMD facilitate molecular flux across cell membranes, promoting tissue adaptation and influencing downstream cellular signaling. The review details how PMD occur and are repaired in various mechanosensitive tissues, including skin, lungs, gut, vasculature, eyes, muscles, neurons, and bone cells. It emphasizes the comparison of repair mechanisms and signaling pathways, with a particular focus on skeletal mechanobiology. The implications of PMD-related processes for disease states and potential therapeutic applications are also discussed.",
