    "summary_full": "This study investigated whether plant responses to spaceflight are essential for adaptation or if they can be genetically reduced without compromising survival. The researchers compared the spaceflight transcriptome of two Arabidopsis ecotypes (Col-0 and WS) and a PhyD mutant of Col-0. In ambient light on the ISS, the phyD mutant showed a significantly reduced transcriptome response compared to Col-0, suggesting that altering a single gene can improve spaceflight adaptation by lowering the transcriptional cost. The WS genotype exhibited an even simpler response, indicating that genotype manipulation can reduce this cost. Interestingly, in darkness on the ISS, WS showed a larger response than Col-0, highlighting the influence of the in-space light environment on adaptation and suggesting habitat manipulation can also impact metabolic cost. The findings suggest that much of the plant's gene expression response to spaceflight may be non-adaptive and dispensable, and that genetic modification could optimize plants for space growth.",

    "conclusions": "Much of the plant response to spaceflight, as measured by gene expression, is potentially non-adaptive and can be genetically eliminated without compromising growth. This suggests that responses to novel environments may involve inappropriately activated signals that can be removed. Genetic manipulation can therefore be used to create varieties better adapted to spaceflight by eliminating unnecessary responses. There is no fundamental, universal spaceflight response; adaptation is dependent on genotype and environment, and appears highly organ-specific. While categories of genes like those involved in cell wall remodeling seem consistently affected, the specific genes and their necessity for adaptation vary.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals that many plant responses to spaceflight are not essential, opening avenues for genetic engineering to create more efficient and robust plants for space agriculture and life support systems."
