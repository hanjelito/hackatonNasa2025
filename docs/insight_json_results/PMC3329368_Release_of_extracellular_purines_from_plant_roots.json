    "summary_full": "This study investigates the role of extracellular purine nucleotides, specifically ATP and ADP, in regulating plant root development and stress responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. The research demonstrates that exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) and L-glutamate can induce ATP accumulation around roots, similar to responses observed with wounding, osmotic stress, and elicitors. The findings suggest that ADP released from root epidermis can activate ionotropic receptor-like activity in the plasma membrane, leading to a transient increase in cytosolic free calcium. Experiments with root epidermal protoplasts confirmed that ADP can elicit calcium-based responses independent of extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), unlike ATP which has been shown to involve ROS production. The study also explores the stereospecificity of L-glutamate's effect and its potential interaction with glutamate receptor-like (GLR) channels. The research highlights the distinct mechanisms by which ATP and ADP influence calcium and potassium ion fluxes at the plasma membrane, suggesting complex signaling pathways involved in plant growth and stress adaptation.",

    "conclusions": "Extracellular ADP and ATP act as signaling molecules in plant roots, influencing calcium and potassium ion fluxes and potentially regulating plant development and stress responses. ADP activates plasma membrane calcium channels directly, while ATP's action involves ROS production. ABA and L-glutamate can also stimulate ATP release, suggesting their involvement in purine nucleotide-mediated signaling pathways.",
