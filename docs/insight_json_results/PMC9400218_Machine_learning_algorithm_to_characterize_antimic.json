    "summary_full": "This study investigates antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes within the International Space Station (ISS) microbiome using a deep learning model. Analyzing shotgun metagenomics data and assembled genomes from ISS environmental samples, the research aimed to identify AMR genes beyond traditional sequence similarity cut-offs. Results showed increased AMR in the last flight, particularly in Kalamiella piersonii, a bacterium linked to human urinary tract infections. Analysis of 226 pure bacterial strains from the ISS revealed numerous AMR genes in species like Enterobacter bugandensis and Bacillus cereus. These computational predictions were experimentally validated through antibiotic resistance profiling, demonstrating high concordance. The study highlights the efficacy of machine learning in uncovering AMR determinants in complex metagenomic datasets, enhancing our understanding of ISS microbial communities and their potential human health implications.",
