    "summary_full": "Stationary-phase bacteria are crucial in disease, and the sigma S (σS)-regulated general stress response (GSR) confers resistance to disinfectants. This study investigates the role of σS in antibiotic resistance, specifically against gentamicin (Gm). Loss of σS in stationary-phase Escherichia coli rendered the bacteria more sensitive to Gm, with proteomic analysis indicating a weakened antioxidant defense. Experiments using reporter assays, fluorescent dyes, and Amplex Red demonstrated that Gm generated more reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the σS mutant. Co-administration of the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and treatment under anaerobic conditions significantly reduced Gm lethality, particularly in the mutant, confirming the contribution of oxidative stress to Gm toxicity. Disruption of antioxidant defense proteins (SodA/SodB, KatE/SodA) or pentose phosphate pathway proteins (Zwf/Gnd, TalA) also increased sensitivity to Gm and elevated oxidative stress. In vivo studies using a uropathogenic E. coli strain in mice showed that the ΔrpoS mutant was more susceptible to Gm in a bladder infection model, and this susceptibility was reversed by NAC treatment. The findings suggest that Gm kills stationary-phase bacteria not only through its established mechanism but also by inducing oxidative stress, and targeting the antioxidant defense could enhance Gm efficacy.",

    "conclusions": "Gentamicin kills stationary-phase Escherichia coli not only by inhibiting protein synthesis but also by inducing oxidative stress. The sigma S (σS) regulator plays a critical role in protecting bacteria against this drug-induced oxidative damage through its regulation of antioxidant defense mechanisms. Compromising this defense, either by deleting σS or by disrupting specific antioxidant or pentose phosphate pathway proteins, leads to increased sensitivity to gentamicin. These findings highlight the importance of the antioxidant defense in bacterial survival and suggest that targeting these pathways could be a strategy to enhance the efficacy of gentamicin and potentially other bactericidal antibiotics.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals that targeting the antioxidant defense system of stationary-phase bacteria can enhance the effectiveness of the antibiotic gentamicin, offering a potential strategy to combat antibiotic resistance."
