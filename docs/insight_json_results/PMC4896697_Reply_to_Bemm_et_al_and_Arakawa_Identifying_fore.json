    "summary_full": "This paper is a response to criticisms regarding the discovery of extensive horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in the tardigrade Hypsibius dujardini genome. The authors acknowledge a mistake in uploading an outdated assembly, which may have contributed to discrepancies. They re-evaluate their findings using independent genome assemblies and multiple filtering approaches (HGT index, prokaryotic vs. eukaryotic alignment, Class C genes). These analyses, applied to independent assemblies, still indicate a substantial proportion of foreign genes (3.8-7.1% by HGT index, 164-384 genes by alignment, 2.5-4.6% for Class C genes), which is elevated compared to typical animals. The authors argue that these foreign genes are unlikely to be mere contaminants, as they are often found on scaffolds with tardigrade genes and are supported by multiple sequencing efforts. They also address the argument that lack of expression disproves HGT, citing examples where HGT genes are expressed at low or undetectable levels. While acknowledging that estimates of HGT vary, they conclude that H. dujardini likely possesses an elevated level of foreign genes acquired through HGT, though possibly not as high as initially reported. They anticipate that future research with new technologies will further refine these estimates.",

    "conclusions": "Despite criticisms and the acknowledgment of an initial error in assembly upload, the authors maintain that their findings of extensive horizontal gene transfer in the Hypsibius dujardini genome are robust. Analyses using independent assemblies and multiple metrics consistently show a significant proportion of foreign genes, elevated compared to other animals. While the exact proportion may vary and requires further investigation with advanced techniques, the evidence strongly suggests that H. dujardini has acquired a substantial number of genes through HGT, rather than these being solely artifacts of contamination.",
    "impact_statement": "This study addresses the significant debate surrounding horizontal gene transfer in tardigrades, providing evidence that supports the acquisition of foreign genes as a notable feature of their genome, which could have implications for their remarkable resilience."
