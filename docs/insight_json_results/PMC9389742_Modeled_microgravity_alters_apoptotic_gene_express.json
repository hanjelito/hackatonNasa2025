    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of modeled microgravity on apoptosis in the symbiotic relationship between the bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes) and the bacterium Vibrio fischeri. The researchers found that microgravity conditions accelerated and increased the expression of apoptosis-related genes, particularly those involved in extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways. Caspase activity, crucial for apoptosis, was also heightened under modeled microgravity. Importantly, these increases in caspase activity could be mitigated using caspase inhibitors, suggesting potential strategies for maintaining host-microbial homeostasis in spaceflight. The study identified a complex network of apoptosis genes in the squid and characterized its caspases, finding them largely conserved across animal species but with some lineage-specific variations. The findings highlight how microgravity can disrupt normal physiological processes, including those influenced by beneficial microbes, and suggest that interventions targeting caspase activity could be beneficial for astronaut health during long-duration space missions.",

    "conclusions": "Modeled microgravity alters the expression of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis gene expression in the squid-vibrio symbiosis, and this process is mediated in part by caspases. The observed increases in caspase activity under modeled microgravity can be pharmacologically inhibited, suggesting that perturbations to the normal apoptosis signaling cascade can be mitigated, which may have broader implications for maintaining animal-microbial homeostasis in spaceflight.",
