    "summary_full": "This review synthesizes current literature on how spaceflight and its analogs affect macrophages, crucial immune cells involved in homeostasis, immunity, and tissue repair. Space exploration exposes astronauts to unique stressors like radiation and altered gravity, which can impact the immune system. Studies show varied effects on immune cell counts and functions, with general trends of altered leukocyte counts and chronic low-grade inflammation in crew members. Macrophages, key players in innate and adaptive immunity, are particularly important to understand due to their role in various physiological processes and diseases. The review details observed changes in macrophage phenotypes and functions, both in-flight and post-flight, across different organisms and mission durations. It highlights discrepancies between human and rodent responses and discusses the influence of microgravity, cosmic radiation, isolation, confinement, hypercapnia, and lunar dust on macrophage biology. Significant knowledge gaps remain, particularly regarding tissue-specific macrophage responses and the combined effects of multiple spaceflight stressors, underscoring the need for further research to develop effective countermeasures for astronaut health.",

    "conclusions": "The spaceflight environment significantly alters macrophage lineages, affecting their function and contributing to immune dysregulation. While current research has identified various impacts of individual stressors like microgravity and radiation, a comprehensive understanding of combined stressors and tissue-specific responses is lacking. Future research must address these gaps to develop effective countermeasures for maintaining astronaut health during long-duration space missions.",
    "impact_statement": "Understanding how spaceflight affects macrophages is crucial for developing countermeasures to protect astronaut immune systems during deep space exploration."
