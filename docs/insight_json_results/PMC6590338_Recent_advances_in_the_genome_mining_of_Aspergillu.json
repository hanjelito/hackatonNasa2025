    "summary_full": "This review summarizes advancements in the genome mining of secondary metabolites (SMs) produced by Aspergillus nidulans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus terreus between 2012 and 2018. It details the genetic identification and molecular characterization of SM biosynthetic gene clusters and proposes biosynthetic pathways for various SMs. The review highlights that while whole genome sequencing has revealed a vast potential for SM production in fungi, many biosynthetic gene clusters remain silent or underexplored. Significant efforts have been made to activate these cryptic pathways and link them to their downstream products, offering a promising avenue for new drug discovery. The review also discusses how understanding these pathways facilitates product yield optimization and the engineering of novel analogs. Specific examples of SM biosynthesis elucidation are provided for each of the four Aspergillus species, showcasing the diverse methodologies employed and the novel compounds discovered.",
