    "summary_full": "This study characterizes an Aspergillus niger strain (JSC-093350089) isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) and compares it to a terrestrial strain (ATCC 1015). Whole-genome sequencing confirmed the ISS isolate belongs to the A. niger clade and falls within the known genetic variance of other A. niger strains. The ISS isolate exhibited a faster growth rate and more extensive pigment distribution compared to the terrestrial strain. Proteomic analysis revealed significant differences in the molecular phenotype, with increased abundance of proteins related to starvation response, oxidative stress resistance, cell wall modulation, and nutrient acquisition in the ISS isolate. These findings suggest a distinct adaptive profile for A. niger inhabiting the spacecraft environment, potentially related to increased melanin production for radiation resistance and enhanced nutrient utilization in a low-nutrient setting. The study highlights the importance of understanding fungal adaptation in space for crew health and long-duration missions.",
