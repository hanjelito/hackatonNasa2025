    "summary_full": "This study presents the draft genome sequences of 20 biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) opportunistic pathogens isolated from environmental surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS). The sequenced strains include Acinetobacter pittii, Enterobacter sp., Pantoea conspicua, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and Staphylococcus hominis. These genomic data are intended to facilitate research into the influence of microgravity on the pathogenicity and virulence of these microorganisms by comparison with Earth-based strains. The genomes were sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq instrument and assembled using the A5 assembly pipeline, with annotation performed by the RAST server. The study provides detailed assembly statistics for each strain, including genome size, contig number, and G+C content.",
