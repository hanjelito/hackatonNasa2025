    "summary_full": "This study leverages NASA's GeneLab omics database to analyze biological responses to space radiation in animal models. By meta-analyzing multiple datasets from ground-based and spaceflight experiments, researchers identified distinct biological signatures associated with specific ions and doses of radiation. Key findings include dose-dependent changes in mitochondrial function, ribosomal assembly, immune pathways, and oncogenic pathways like KRAS. The analysis also explored RNA-specific error rates and confirmed the absence of global batch effects. The study concludes that GeneLab's extensive data can generate novel hypotheses to understand human health risks from galactic cosmic ray (GCR) exposures and suggests potential targets for countermeasures.",
