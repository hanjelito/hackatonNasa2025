    "summary_full": "This study investigated the impact of spaceflight on the gut microbiome and host gene expression in mice aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Using multiomics approaches (metagenomics and transcriptomics), researchers analyzed samples from mice flown for 29 and 56 days compared to ground controls. Spaceflight led to significant alterations in the gut microbiota, with reductions in bacteria involved in bile acid and butyrate metabolism, such as Extibacter muris and Dysosmobacter welbionis. Functional predictions indicated an over-representation of genes related to fatty acid and bile acid metabolism, extracellular matrix interactions, and antibiotic resistance. Host gene expression in the colon and liver showed corresponding changes in bile acid and energy metabolism, and immune suppression. These findings suggest that host-gut microbiome interactions play a critical role in spaceflight-associated pathologies and could influence the feasibility of long-duration space missions.",
