    "summary_full": "This study investigates the mechanisms behind microbial adaptation to the spaceflight environment, specifically on the International Space Station (ISS). The researchers analyzed 245 bacterial genomes isolated from the ISS, focusing on dormant bacteriophages (prophages) within these genomes. They found significant differences in phage-associated genes between spaceflight strains and their terrestrial counterparts. A substantial number of complete prophages were identified, including novel ones, which encode functions related to persistence in extreme environments, such as antimicrobial resistance, DNA damage repair, and dormancy. These findings suggest that bacteriophage-encoded functions play a role in microbial adaptation to spaceflight and may have implications for human health in space.",
