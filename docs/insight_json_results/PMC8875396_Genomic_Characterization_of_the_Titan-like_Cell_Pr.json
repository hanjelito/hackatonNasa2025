    "summary_full": "This study describes the isolation and characterization of a novel yeast species, Naganishia tulchinskyi, from the International Space Station (ISS). The yeast exhibits a 'Titan-like' cell morphology, characterized by enlarged size and thicker cell walls, when grown under simulated microgravity and 5% CO2 conditions. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed its status as a new species closely related to Naganishia diffluens. Genomic analysis revealed genes associated with cell morphogenesis, response to UV light, and potential adaptations to microgravity and radiation. The study also observed unique traits like shedding bud scars under simulated microgravity, suggesting complex cellular responses to the space environment. The findings have implications for understanding microbial adaptation in space and potential emergence of virulence.",
