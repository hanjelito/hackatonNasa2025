    "summary_full": "This review explores the role of lipid rafts, specialized microdomains within plant cell membranes, in sensing and responding to gravity and other environmental stressors. These rafts, enriched in specific lipids and proteins, are crucial for various cellular processes including signaling, transport, and endo/exocytosis. Studies using clinorotation (simulated microgravity) on pea seedlings show that lipid rafts undergo changes, such as increased saturated fatty acid content and cholesterol, suggesting increased membrane rigidity and reduced permeability. Filipin and laurdan staining experiments further support these findings, indicating altered cholesterol distribution and increased ordered membrane domains under clinorotation. The paper highlights the intricate link between lipid rafts, the cytoskeleton, and mechanosensitive ion channels, proposing that these structures are fundamental to plant gravisensitivity. Understanding lipid rafts is essential for optimizing plant growth in bioregenerative life support systems for space exploration.",
