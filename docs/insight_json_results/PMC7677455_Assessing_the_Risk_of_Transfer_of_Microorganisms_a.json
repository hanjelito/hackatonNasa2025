    "summary_full": "This study investigated the microbial contamination risk associated with commercial resupply vehicles (CRVs) delivering cargo to the International Space Station (ISS), serving as a model for planetary protection. Samples from three CRV missions were analyzed using cultivation and metagenomic techniques. Internal CRV surfaces generally showed lower microbial loads than ground support equipment (GSE). The first CRV mission had a higher microbial population than subsequent missions, which were cleaner. Cultivation identified Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota. Metagenomic analysis revealed a broader diversity, including UV-tolerant microorganisms like Bacillus firmus. Crucially, CRV microbiomes clustered separately from the ISS microbiome, indicating that CRV cleaning protocols are highly effective in controlling microbial contamination during cargo transfer.",

    "conclusions": "The study concludes that commercial resupply vehicles (CRVs) pose a negligible risk of transferring microorganisms to the International Space Station (ISS). Significant differences were observed between the CRV and ISS microbiomes, with CRV cleaning protocols proving highly effective in controlling microbial populations. Continued adherence to these protocols is recommended to prevent forward contamination of the ISS.",
