    "summary_full": "This study investigates the molecular mechanisms behind rapid bone loss induced by ionizing radiation, relevant to radiotherapy and long-duration space missions. Adult male mice were exposed to either gamma rays or heavy ions (iron). Gene expression in serum, marrow, and mineralized tissue was analyzed at various time points post-irradiation. Both types of radiation significantly increased the expression of Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor kappa-B Ligand (Rankl), a key cytokine for osteoclastogenesis, in marrow cells. This increase preceded and overlapped with elevated expression of other pro-osteoclastogenic and pro-inflammatory cytokines like monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (Mcp1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (Tnf). The ratio of Rankl to its inhibitor Osteoprotegerin (Opg) also increased, indicating a pro-resorption balance. Expression of the antioxidant transcription factor Nfe2l2 correlated with osteoclast-related genes. Radiation exposure also increased a serum marker of bone resorption (tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase) and led to a measurable decrease in cancellous bone volume within a week. The findings suggest that total body irradiation triggers temporal elevations in genes related to bone resorption and osteoclastogenesis, contributing to rapid bone deterioration.",

    "conclusions": "Total body irradiation, whether from gamma rays or heavy ions, induces temporal elevations in genes associated with bone resorption and osteoclastogenesis within marrow and mineralized tissues. These molecular changes, including increased Rankl and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, precede and likely account for the rapid and progressive deterioration of cancellous bone microarchitecture observed after radiation exposure.",
