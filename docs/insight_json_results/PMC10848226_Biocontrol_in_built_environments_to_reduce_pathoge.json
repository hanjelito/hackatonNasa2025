    "summary_full": "This review explores the potential of using microbial biocontrol agents, primarily Bacillus species, to combat antibiotic-resistant pathogens in built environments like hospitals and homes. Traditional cleaning methods are becoming less effective due to evolving pathogen resistance. The paper discusses current understanding of indoor microbiomes, the challenges in studying them, and proposes strategies for translating this knowledge into effective biocontrol. It highlights the use of Bacillus spores in cleaning products and printable materials, noting their ability to survive harsh conditions and potentially outcompete or inhibit pathogens. The review also covers advanced techniques like genome-scale metabolic modeling and multi-omics approaches to understand microbial interactions and inform biocontrol strategies. While promising, further research is needed to elucidate mechanisms of action, optimize application methods, and assess long-term impacts and public perception.",

    "conclusions": "Microbial biocontrol, particularly using Bacillus species, offers a promising avenue to combat antibiotic-resistant pathogens in built environments. While initial studies show significant reductions in pathogens and AMR genes in healthcare settings, further research is crucial to understand the underlying ecological mechanisms, optimize application strategies, and address potential challenges like pathogen adaptation and public perception. Integrating advanced modeling and experimental techniques will be key to developing effective and sustainable biocontrol solutions for improved indoor health.",
