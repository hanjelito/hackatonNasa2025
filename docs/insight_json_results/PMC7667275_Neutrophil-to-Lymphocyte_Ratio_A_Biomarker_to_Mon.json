    "summary_full": "This study investigates the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a potential biomarker for monitoring astronaut immune status during spaceflight. Spaceflight is known to cause immune dysfunction, and elevated NLR is associated with inflammation on Earth. The researchers used both spaceflight data from astronauts and rodents, and ground-based simulated microgravity models (high-aspect rotating wall vessels for human leukocytes and hindlimb unloading in mice) to assess NLR changes. Both spaceflight and simulated microgravity conditions led to elevated NLR, primarily due to increased neutrophil counts and activation, and in some cases, decreased lymphocyte counts or increased apoptosis. Simulated microgravity also induced oxidative stress and activated neutrophils, which could be partially reversed by antioxidant treatment (N-acetyl cysteine and catalase). The findings suggest that NLR is a promising biomarker for in-flight immune health monitoring and that antioxidants may serve as countermeasures against spaceflight-induced inflammation.",

    "conclusions": "The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is elevated in both spaceflight and simulated microgravity conditions, suggesting it is a potential biomarker for monitoring astronaut immune status. Simulated microgravity induces oxidative stress and neutrophil activation, which can be mitigated by antioxidants. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring NLR and exploring antioxidant countermeasures to safeguard astronaut health during long-duration space missions.",
