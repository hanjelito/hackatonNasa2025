    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of lunar gravity (1/6 g) on mouse salivary glands using the Multiple Artificial Gravity Research System (MARS) aboard the International Space Station. Researchers exposed mice to lunar gravity and Earth gravity, then analyzed their submandibular glands upon return. The findings indicate that lunar gravity significantly upregulates the expression of the salivary amylase gene (Amy1) in acinar cells. This upregulation is associated with increased expression of genes involved in vesicle secretion, such as Vamp8 (a v-SNARE) and small G proteins (Rap1, Rab2a, Rab10, Rab27), suggesting enhanced exocytosis of amylase. Genes regulating water secretion (Aqp5, Ano1) did not show significant changes. The study also observed upregulation of genes related to oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis. Mechanosensitive ion channels were downregulated. The authors conclude that lunar gravity promotes salivary amylase secretion via Rap/Rab signaling and exocytosis mediated by Vamp8, highlighting Amy1 as a potential stress marker in lunar gravity environments.",

    "conclusions": "Lunar gravity upregulates salivary amylase secretion via Rap/Rab signaling and exocytosis mediated by Vamp8 at the apical side of acinar cells. Amy1 is identified as a potential candidate marker for stress regulation in salivary glands within a lunar gravity environment. The study suggests that changes in gravitational environments induce qualitative changes in salivary secretion function, involving multiple genes to maintain homeostasis.",
    "impact_statement": "This study identifies specific molecular mechanisms by which lunar gravity affects salivary gland function, highlighting amylase as a potential stress biomarker for space exploration and informing strategies for maintaining astronaut health."
