    "document_title": "A method for preparing spaceflight RNAlater-fixed Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae) tissue for scanning electron microscopy",
    "summary_full": "This study presents a protocol for preparing Arabidopsis thaliana tissue, fixed with RNAlater for molecular analysis, for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Traditional spaceflight experiments require separate fixatives for morphological and molecular studies, limiting sample utility. This new method aims to maximize sample usage by enabling SEM imaging from RNAlater-fixed tissues, which is particularly valuable for spaceflight where resources are limited. The protocol involves desalting RNAlater-fixed samples, dehydrating them through methanol, flash-freezing in liquid ethane, freeze-substitution, critical point drying, sputter-coating, and SEM imaging. The developed protocol successfully produced acceptable SEM images, preserving general morphology and fine details like root hairs and trichomes, comparable to fresh-frozen samples. This method offers increased experimental flexibility for both spaceflight and terrestrial studies, allowing researchers to obtain morphological data from samples initially preserved for molecular analysis.",
