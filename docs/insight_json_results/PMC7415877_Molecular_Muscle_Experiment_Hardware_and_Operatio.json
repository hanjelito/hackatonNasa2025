    "summary_full": "This paper details the design, validation, and operational lessons learned from the Molecular Muscle Experiment (MME), which used the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) to study spaceflight-induced muscle decline. Due to the unavailability of previous hardware, new flight hardware, including experimental cassettes and culture bags, had to be designed and validated. Key challenges included selecting appropriate gas-permeable culture bags that could support worm growth and optimizing culture volumes and timings to accommodate potential launch delays and passive temperature control during spaceflight. The study found that polyethylene (PE) bags were suitable for C. elegans growth, and that culture volumes between 5-7 mL provided an optimal surface area to volume ratio for gas exchange. The use of a chemically defined medium (CeMM) instead of a bacterial diet (OP50) was also explored as a way to reduce oxygen consumption, though it presents contamination risks. The validation of new experimental cassettes and the testing of various upload scenarios, including passive cold stowage using phase change materials, were crucial for ensuring experimental success despite launch delays. The findings provide a valuable framework for future astrobiology experiments involving C. elegans on the International Space Station.",
