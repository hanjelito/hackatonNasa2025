    "summary_full": "This study investigated the individual and combined effects of reduced weight bearing (hindlimb unloading, HLU) and low-dose radiation (≤1 Gy) on knee and hip joint cartilage in mice. Eighty C57BL/6J mice were subjected to HLU or remained weight-bearing, and then exposed to 0, 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 Gy of X-rays. After 30 days, cartilage volume and thickness were reduced, particularly at weight-bearing contact points, in all treatment groups compared to controls. Collagen content was also decreased. Circulating serum cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (sCOMP), a marker of cartilage degradation, increased in all irradiated groups. Proteomic analysis revealed a decrease in cartilage compositional proteins indicative of osteoarthritis. The findings demonstrate that both HLU and spaceflight-relevant radiation doses, individually and combined, lead to cartilage degradation and an arthritic phenotype, with low-dose irradiation causing an active catabolic response.",

    "conclusions": "Both hindlimb unloading and spaceflight-relevant low-dose radiation, individually and in combination, lead to cartilage degradation and an arthritic phenotype in mouse knee and hip joints. These challenges, particularly low-dose radiation, induce an early catabolic response in cartilage, highlighting a significant risk to astronaut joint health during long-duration space missions.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals that combined spaceflight hazards of reduced weight bearing and low-dose radiation significantly damage joint cartilage, potentially accelerating osteoarthritis in astronauts and necessitating the development of protective countermeasures."
