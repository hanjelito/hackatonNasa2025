    "document_title": "Molecular and physiological changes in the SpaceX Inspiration4 civilian crew",
    "summary_full": "The SpaceX Inspiration4 mission, the first all-civilian crew to low Earth orbit, provided a unique opportunity to study the physiological and molecular responses to short-duration spaceflight. Researchers collected extensive multi-omic, physiological, and cognitive data from the four crew members before, during, and after the 3-day mission. Key findings include broad molecular changes across multiple biological layers, some mirroring those seen in long-duration missions, such as inflammatory responses and DNA repair gene enrichment. While most physiological and cognitive metrics returned to baseline post-flight, some changes, like telomere elongation and altered immune reactivity to viruses (e.g., Epstein-Barr virus), were observed. The mission also demonstrated the feasibility of using novel technologies like handheld ultrasound and smartwatch wearables for autonomous data collection in civilian crews. Overall, the data suggest that short-duration civilian space missions do not pose a significant health risk and provide valuable insights into the early stages of human adaptation to space.",

        "Cardiovascular metrics like heart rate and heart rate variability showed changes during flight, with significant inter-individual variability, but largely returned to baseline post-flight.",
        "Cognitive performance was largely unaffected, though some tests showed slower response speeds and, in one case, reduced accuracy, with most deficits resolving post-flight."
