    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of microgravity on Brachypodium distachyon seedlings, a monocot model plant, grown on the International Space Station (ISS). Three accessions (Bd21, Bd21-3, and Gaz8) were compared to ground controls. Microgravity exposure resulted in shorter roots and longer root hairs across all accessions. Shoot growth was also reduced in the Bd21 accession under microgravity, while Bd21-3 and Gaz8 showed similar shoot growth rates. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant accession-specific responses to microgravity, with Gaz8 exhibiting the largest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by Bd21 and Bd21-3. Common DEGs between accessions were enriched for photosynthesis-related genes, which were down-regulated in shoots. Oxidative stress response genes were differentially regulated in shoots and roots, suggesting distinct adaptation strategies. The study also identified potential roles for retrograde signaling and PIF genes in mediating shoot responses to microgravity, and highlighted accession-specific differences in transcriptional and post-translational regulation pathways. Overall, Brachypodium seedlings exhibit complex, accession- and organ-specific responses to microgravity, with implications for developing crops for space exploration.",
