    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effectiveness of a dried plum powder (DP) diet as a countermeasure against bone loss induced by simulated spaceflight conditions, which combine microgravity (simulated by hindlimb unloading, HU) and ionizing radiation (IR). The DP diet was found to prevent most of the bone micro-architectural and mechanical property decrements caused by HU alone and by the combination of HU and IR in mice. Specifically, the DP diet protected both cancellous and cortical bone in the tibia and vertebrae. Furthermore, the DP diet protected osteoprogenitor cells from impairments caused by simulated microgravity. These findings suggest that dietary supplementation with dried plum powder could be a viable countermeasure for skeletal deficits experienced by astronauts during spaceflight.",

        "While ionizing radiation alone caused some bone loss, its effects were largely prevented by the DP diet, and its combination with hindlimb unloading did not show additive detrimental effects on bone structure.",
        "The DP diet showed a potential anabolic effect on cortical bone in non-stressed conditions, increasing vertebral bone volume fraction compared to the control diet."

    "conclusions": "A diet supplemented with dried plum powder effectively mitigates bone loss and structural deterioration in mice exposed to simulated spaceflight conditions, including hindlimb unloading and irradiation. The DP diet protects both cancellous and cortical bone, preserves vertebral strength, and safeguards osteoprogenitor cells from microgravity-induced damage, suggesting its potential as a countermeasure for skeletal health in astronauts.",
    "impact_statement": "This study demonstrates that a dietary supplement of dried plum powder can protect against bone loss induced by simulated spaceflight, offering a promising, natural countermeasure for astronaut skeletal health."
