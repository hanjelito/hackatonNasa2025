    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of lycopene and fish oil supplements on gene expression in men with low-burden prostate cancer undergoing active surveillance. The researchers hypothesized that lycopene would down-regulate insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and fish oil would down-regulate cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), both implicated in prostate cancer progression. A 3-month randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted with 69 participants receiving either lycopene, fish oil, or placebo. Gene expression in normal prostate tissue was assessed using qRT-PCR. The results showed no significant difference in the change of IGF-1 expression between the placebo and lycopene groups, nor in COX-2 expression between the placebo and fish oil groups. The study concluded that these supplements did not significantly alter the expression of these key genes in the normal prostate microenvironment over a 3-month period. Further analysis of global gene expression might be needed to understand the bioactivity of these nutrients.",

    "conclusions": "A 3-month intervention with lycopene or fish oil supplements did not significantly alter the gene expression of IGF-1 and COX-2, respectively, in the normal prostate microenvironment of men on active surveillance for low-burden prostate cancer. These findings suggest that, under the conditions of this study, these specific nutritional interventions do not impact these particular molecular pathways relevant to prostate carcinogenesis.",
    "impact_statement": "This study suggests that short-term supplementation with lycopene or fish oil may not influence key gene expression pathways related to prostate cancer progression in men on active surveillance, highlighting the need for further research into the efficacy of nutritional interventions."
