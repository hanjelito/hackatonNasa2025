    "document_title": "Caenorhabditis elegans in microgravity: An omics perspective",
    "summary_full": "This review explores the application of omics technologies (transcriptomics, genomics, proteomics, multi-omics, and integrated omics) to study the biological impacts of spaceflight on Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). It highlights molecular alterations, particularly in metabolic and neuromuscular gene regulation, observed in spaceflown C. elegans. These changes are reproducible and seen in other species like mice and astronauts, validating C. elegans as a model organism for spaceflight physiology research with translational relevance. The review discusses current findings, the impact of omics studies, and future research directions, emphasizing the integration of tissue-specific, spatial, and multi-omics approaches to link molecular responses to phenotypic adaptations and identify therapeutic targets.",

These findings, consistent across different missions and culturing conditions, underscore C. elegans' value as a model for spaceflight research. Future research should leverage advanced omics techniques like multi-omics and spatial transcriptomics to elucidate tissue-specific responses and identify therapeutic targets, ultimately benefiting astronaut health and understanding age-related diseases on Earth.",
