    "summary_full": "This study investigates the role of brassinosteroids (BRs) and the transcription factor BZR1 in regulating cell division and differentiation in Arabidopsis root tips. The research demonstrates that BRs, acting through the BZR1-mediated signaling pathway, promote ectopic cell division in the quiescent center (QC) while simultaneously suppressing the differentiation of columella stem cells (CSCs). This effect is concentration-dependent and involves alterations in the expression and localization of PIN proteins, which in turn affects auxin distribution. BZR1 directly binds to the promoters of several root development-regulating genes, modulating their expression. The study concludes that BZR1-dependent BR signaling antagonizes auxin-dependent CSC differentiation and contributes to the maintenance of root apical meristem activity by stimulating QC division and inhibiting CSC differentiation.",

    "conclusions": "Brassinosteroid (BR) signaling, particularly through the transcription factor BZR1, plays a crucial role in regulating root apical meristem activity. BRs promote ectopic division of quiescent center (QC) cells while suppressing the differentiation of columella stem cells (CSCs). This is achieved by modulating auxin distribution through changes in PIN protein activity and by directly regulating the expression of various root development-related genes. The effects of BRs are concentration-dependent and show differential impacts on CSC differentiation, with low concentrations inhibiting and high concentrations promoting it. BZR1-mediated BR signaling acts antagonistically to auxin in regulating CSC differentiation.",
