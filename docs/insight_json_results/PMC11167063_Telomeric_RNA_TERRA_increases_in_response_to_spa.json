    "summary_full": "This study investigates the role of Telomeric RNA (TERRA) in the DNA damage response (DDR) under spaceflight and high-altitude conditions. Researchers found that TERRA levels significantly increase in astronauts during spaceflight and in high-altitude climbers, correlating with radiation exposure. In vitro experiments showed that ionizing radiation, but not simulated microgravity, also increases TERRA transcription. The study provides evidence that TERRA forms protective hybrids with telomeric DNA at double-strand break sites, suggesting a role in facilitating recombination-mediated telomere elongation. These findings have implications for understanding persistent telomeric DNA damage in conditions like aging and chronic radiation exposure, and for developing therapeutic strategies targeting TERRA in ALT-positive tumors.",

    "conclusions": "TERRA transcription is upregulated in response to telomeric damage, particularly double-strand breaks, which are induced by space radiation and high-altitude environments. TERRA plays a protective role by forming hybrids with telomeric DNA at break sites, facilitating recombination-mediated repair and telomere elongation. This mechanism is crucial for maintaining genome stability under conditions of chronic oxidative stress and radiation exposure, and presents a potential therapeutic target for ALT-positive cancers.",
