    "summary_full": "This study investigated the behavior of human oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) after space flight to understand their role in space-induced intracranial hypertension (ICP) and visual impairment (VIIP). OLPs were sent to the International Space Station for 38 days and their behavior was monitored using time-lapse microscopy upon return. Results showed that space-flown OLPs (SPC-OLPs) exhibited increased proliferation, with a subpopulation displaying significantly shorter cell cycles (6.6h or 3.3h) compared to ground controls (GC-OLPs, ~19.76h). Additionally, SPC-OLPs showed a significant increase in autophagic cell death. Proteomic analysis of the secretome from SPC-OLPs revealed upregulation of stress protein HSP-90β and secreted protein SPARC, both implicated in ER stress and autophagy. The findings suggest that these proteins may be key targets for modulating OLP proliferation and autophagy to mitigate ICP and VIIP in astronauts.",

    "conclusions": "Space flight significantly alters oligodendrocyte progenitor cell behavior, leading to enhanced proliferation and increased autophagy, potentially mediated by the upregulation of HSP-90β and SPARC. These changes may contribute to space-induced intracranial hypertension and visual impairment, but also present opportunities for therapeutic interventions and for generating OLPs for regenerative medicine on Earth.",
