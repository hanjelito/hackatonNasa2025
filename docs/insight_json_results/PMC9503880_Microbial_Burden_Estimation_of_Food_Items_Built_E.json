    "summary_full": "This study compares the performance of film media (Petrifilm and Easy Plates) against traditional agar media for enumerating cultivable microbes from food items, built environments on Earth, and surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS). Film media demonstrated comparable results to agar for bacterial counts in food and built environments (R2 values of 0.94-0.96). Fungal counts showed a lower correlation (R2 values of 0.72-0.73). For ISS samples, which had very low microbial loads, film media (Easy Plates) showed R2 values of 0.80 for bacteria and 0.73 for fungi, with film media being more likely to detect microbes above the detection limit. Species composition of isolates was generally similar between media types, though some differences in isolation of slow-growing or specific yeast species were noted. The study concludes that film media are viable alternatives to agar plates for low-biomass environments and food samples, offering advantages in reduced waste, preparation time, and incubator space, and may be suitable for microgravity applications.",
