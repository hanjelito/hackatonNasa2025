    "summary_full": "This study presents the development of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) functionalized with anti-spike antibodies for the rapid diagnosis and inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. The GNPs exhibit a colorimetric change from pink to blue upon aggregation in the presence of COVID-19 antigen or pseudo SARS-CoV-2, allowing for naked-eye detection within 5 minutes at concentrations of 1 ng/mL for antigen and 1000 particles/mL for virus. For enhanced sensitivity, Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) was employed, achieving detection limits of 4 pg/mL for antigen and 18 particles/mL for virus within the same timeframe. FDTD simulations indicated a 4-orders-of-magnitude Raman enhancement in nanoparticle aggregates. Furthermore, the anti-spike antibody-coated GNPs demonstrated a 100% inhibition efficiency against pseudo SARS-CoV-2 infection in HEK293T cells by blocking viral entry and potentially damaging the viral lipid membrane.",
