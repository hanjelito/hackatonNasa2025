    "summary_full": "This study details the redesign and integration of the NemaFlex microfluidic device for measuring Caenorhabditis elegans muscle strength in microgravity on the International Space Station (ISS). The original NemaFlex device was modified to address spaceflight constraints, including mixed animal cultures, limited astronaut time, and crew safety. Key technical advancements include a new microfluidic device design for sorting animals by size into individual chambers, a fluid handling protocol to prevent clogging and bubbles during animal injection, and a custom worm-loading apparatus for easy manipulation and containment. Earth-based validation studies confirmed the hardware's functionality, leading to its successful deployment on the ISS. The developed hardware and protocols enable multi-generational studies of C. elegans muscle strength in space, providing a valuable tool for understanding the effects of microgravity on muscle physiology.",
