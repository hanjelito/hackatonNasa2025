    "summary_full": "This study investigated the impact of the human spaceflight environment on the growth and antibiotic resistance mutation frequency of Staphylococcus epidermidis. Cultures were grown on the International Space Station (ISS) and compared to ground controls. S. epidermidis exhibited lower viable counts but significantly higher frequencies of mutation to rifampicin resistance in space compared to ground controls. Furthermore, the spectrum of mutations in the rpoB gene leading to rifampicin resistance was altered in space-cultivated isolates. These findings suggest that the spaceflight environment imposes unique physiological stresses on bacteria, leading to changes in their mutagenic potential.",

    "conclusions": "The human spaceflight environment significantly alters the growth characteristics and the frequency and spectrum of spontaneous mutations to rifampicin resistance in Staphylococcus epidermidis. Specifically, spaceflight leads to reduced viable cell counts but increased mutation rates and a shift in the types of mutations occurring in the rpoB gene. These findings highlight the unique stresses of spaceflight and their potential to influence bacterial evolution and antibiotic resistance.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals that the spaceflight environment can increase the rate and alter the pattern of antibiotic resistance mutations in bacteria, posing potential risks for infectious diseases in astronauts and influencing strategies for microbial management in space habitats."
