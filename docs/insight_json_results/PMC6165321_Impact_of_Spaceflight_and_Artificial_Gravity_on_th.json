    "document_title": "Impact of Spaceflight and Artificial Gravity on the Mouse Retina: Biochemical and Proteomic Analysis",
    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of spaceflight on mouse retinas, examining protein expression and oxidative stress-associated apoptosis. Mice were sent to the ISS for 35 days, with some experiencing microgravity (µg) and others artificial gravity (µg + 1 g). Results showed that microgravity significantly increased apoptosis in retinal vascular endothelial cells compared to control groups. Proteomic analysis revealed altered pathways related to cell death, repair, inflammation, and metabolic stress in µg mice. Artificial gravity provided some protection against these microgravity-induced changes. These findings suggest that spaceflight can damage retinal cells, potentially affecting blood-retinal barrier integrity and visual acuity, and that artificial gravity may mitigate these effects.",
