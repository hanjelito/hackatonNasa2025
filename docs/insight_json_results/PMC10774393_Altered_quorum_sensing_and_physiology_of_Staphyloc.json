    "summary_full": "This study investigated the physiological and virulence responses of Staphylococcus aureus to spaceflight conditions using multi-omics data (RNA-Seq, proteomics, metabolomics) from the BRIC-23 experiment on the International Space Station. Results showed significant upregulation of the Agr quorum sensing system and its downstream virulence factors, including proteases and secreted toxins like EsxA. Metabolism was also altered, with increased urease activity and arginine metabolism, and a shift towards catabolizing non-preferred carbon sources. These changes suggest that S. aureus may increase its pathogenic potential in the spaceflight environment due to enhanced quorum sensing and virulence factor expression, alongside metabolic adaptations.",

    "conclusions": "The spaceflight environment induces significant alterations in Staphylococcus aureus, characterized by heightened quorum sensing activity, increased expression of both Agr-dependent and independent virulence factors, and metabolic shifts. These changes suggest an elevated pathogenic potential for S. aureus during space missions, posing a potential risk to astronaut health.",
