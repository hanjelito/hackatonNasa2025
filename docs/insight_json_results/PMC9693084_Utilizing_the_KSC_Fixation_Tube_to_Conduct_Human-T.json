    "document_title": "Utilizing the KSC Fixation Tube to Conduct Human-Tended Plant Biology Experiments on a Suborbital Spaceflight",
    "summary_full": "This paper describes a method for conducting human-tended plant biology experiments on suborbital spaceflights using KSC Fixation Tubes (KFTs). These tubes, preloaded with RNAlater, can house plant samples on support media and fix them at specific stages of flight, fulfilling triple containment requirements for spacecraft. A simulated suborbital flight profile was used to test the KFTs. RNA-seq analysis showed that plants grown in KFTs behaved consistently with those in petri plates, with roots adjusting to hypoxia and leaves to changes in photosynthesis. The study validated that KFTs can maintain plant health for several hours, allowing for pre-flight preparation and human-tended experiments. Furthermore, clinorotation experiments within KFTs demonstrated the potential to capture transcriptomic responses to gravity changes, suggesting this method is a viable approach for hands-on research in suborbital space.",
