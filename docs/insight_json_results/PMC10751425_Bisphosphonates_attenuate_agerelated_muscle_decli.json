    "summary_full": "This study investigates the potential of bisphosphonates, specifically zoledronic acid (ZA), as a therapy for age-related muscle decline (sarcopenia). Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism, researchers treated animals with varying concentrations of ZA and assessed lifespan and healthspan (movement rates). Results showed that low doses of ZA (100 nM and 1 μM) extended both lifespan and healthspan, while higher doses were detrimental or lethal. ZA treatment also improved myofibrillar structure and mitochondrial integrity in aging muscles. Mechanistic studies using RNAi knockdown revealed that ZA-mediated healthspan extension relies on the mevalonate pathway (fdps-1) and the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor. Additionally, muscle-derived factors like agxt-2/BAIBA and mitochondrial sirtuins (sir-2.3) were implicated in ZA's beneficial effects. The findings suggest that bisphosphonates could be a viable therapeutic strategy for combating sarcopenia, acting through conserved pathways independent of bone.",

    "conclusions": "Zoledronic acid, a bisphosphonate, effectively delays age-related muscle decline (sarcopenia) in Caenorhabditis elegans, leading to improved neuromuscular function and extended healthspan. The drug acts through conserved pathways including the mevalonate-FOXO axis, mitochondrial sirtuins, and muscle-derived signaling molecules, independent of bone. These findings strongly suggest that bisphosphonates could be a readily available and safe therapeutic option for combating sarcopenia.",
    "impact_statement": "This study provides evidence that bisphosphonates, commonly used for osteoporosis, can effectively combat age-related muscle decline, offering a potential new therapeutic avenue for sarcopenia."
