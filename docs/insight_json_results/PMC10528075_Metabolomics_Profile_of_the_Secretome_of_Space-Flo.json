    "summary_full": "This study investigated the impact of space microgravity (ÂµG) on oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs), crucial for myelin formation in the central nervous system, and their secretome. OLPs flown on the International Space Station for 26 days showed increased glutamate and energy metabolism. Post-flight, these space-flown OLPs (SPC OLPs) exhibited significantly enhanced mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis compared to ground controls. Global metabolomics revealed endogenous metabolites secreted by OLPs that were modulated by microgravity. The findings suggest that microgravity alters OLP metabolism, potentially maintaining them in an immature stage, and highlights increased energy demand and glutamate production. These metabolic changes are proposed as potential therapeutic targets for mitigating spaceflight-induced neurological issues like intracranial hypertension and visual impairment.",
