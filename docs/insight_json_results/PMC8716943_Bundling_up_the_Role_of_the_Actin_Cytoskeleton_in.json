    "summary_full": "This review comprehensively examines the critical role of the actin cytoskeleton in primary root growth, a process essential for plant anchorage, nutrient acquisition, and obstacle navigation. It details how actin-binding proteins, plant hormones (particularly auxin), and actin-disrupting drugs influence root growth and actin organization. The review highlights the feedback loop between actin and root responses to light and gravity, emphasizing actin's involvement in cell division and elongation through its own organization. Specifically, longitudinally oriented actin bundles are identified as crucial for cell elongation, alongside actin's role in protein trafficking and vacuolar reshaping. The paper discusses the specialization of actin-binding proteins and their connection to developmental effects, as well as actin's necessity in perceiving gravity stimuli via statolith repositioning and mediating growth responses through auxin transporter trafficking. While recent techniques have advanced understanding, significant gaps remain in fully elucidating how actin organization shapes cells and drives root growth, particularly concerning its interaction with light.",

    "conclusions": "The actin cytoskeleton is indispensable for primary root growth, regulating cell division, elongation, and response to environmental cues like gravity and light. Its organization is developmentally regulated, with bundled, longitudinal filaments characteristic of cell elongation. Hormonal signaling, particularly auxin, intricately interacts with the actin cytoskeleton, influencing its dynamics and vice versa, thereby controlling root development and tropisms. While significant progress has been made, further research is needed to fully understand the roles of specific actin-binding proteins, the impact of light, and the detailed mechanisms of hormone-actin crosstalk.",
