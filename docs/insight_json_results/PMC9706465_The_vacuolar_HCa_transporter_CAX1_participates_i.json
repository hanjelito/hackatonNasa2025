    "summary_full": "This study investigates the role of the vacuolar H+/Ca transporter CAX1 in plant responses to anoxia and submergence. The researchers found that Arabidopsis mutants lacking functional CAX1 (cax1 mutants) exhibit increased tolerance to both anoxic conditions and submergence compared to wild-type plants. Through phenotypic analysis, RNA-sequencing, and proteomics, they identified that cax1 mutants show altered metabolic processes, reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production after anoxia, and modified hormone signaling. Calcium imaging revealed altered cytosolic Ca signals in cax1 mutants during reoxygenation. The findings suggest that anoxia-induced Ca signals around the plant vacuole are crucial for adaptation to low oxygen stress, and that the CAX1 pathway could be a target for engineering improved flooding tolerance in crops.",

    "conclusions": "The study demonstrates that the vacuolar H+/Ca transporter CAX1 plays a detrimental role in anoxia and submergence tolerance in Arabidopsis. Loss of CAX1 function leads to a complex suite of physiological and molecular adaptations, including altered metabolism, reduced oxidative stress, and modified calcium signaling, ultimately conferring enhanced tolerance to low oxygen conditions. These findings highlight the importance of vacuolar calcium transport in plant stress responses and suggest potential targets for agricultural improvement.",
    "impact_statement": "This research identifies a key vacuolar calcium transporter, CAX1, as a negative regulator of anoxia and submergence tolerance, offering a potential target for engineering crops with improved resilience to flooding."
