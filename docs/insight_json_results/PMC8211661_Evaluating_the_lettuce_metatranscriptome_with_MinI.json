    "summary_full": "This study developed and evaluated a methodology for analyzing the metatranscriptome of microbial communities associated with red romaine lettuce grown under International Space Station (ISS)-like conditions, using the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing platform. The researchers optimized an RNA enrichment protocol to isolate microbial transcripts from host-microbe total RNA, achieving a significant depletion of plant RNA. The MinION platform was used to sequence the enriched microbial RNA, and a bioinformatics pipeline was established for data analysis. The results demonstrated the feasibility and reproducibility of this approach for on-site detection of microbial transcriptional activity. The study identified key bacterial and fungal taxa and their functional gene expression profiles within the lettuce microbiome, highlighting pathways related to metabolism and signal transduction. This metatranscriptomic approach offers a rapid, on-orbit monitoring tool for assessing plant health and facilitating sustainable food production in space.",
