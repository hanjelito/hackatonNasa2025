    "summary_full": "This review focuses on the SARS-CoV-2 virus's mechanism of infection and its ability to adapt and restructure the intracellular environment to support viral replication. It highlights current knowledge from viral, cellular, and clinical biology experts, aiming to explain the varied clinical observations in COVID-19 patients. The review details the virus's structure, its interaction with host cells via the ACE2 receptor, and the subsequent intracellular processes triggered. It discusses the impact of viral mutations on transmissibility and immune evasion, and the diverse cellular responses influenced by cell type, genetics, and clinical context. Key intracellular pathways affected include calcium signaling, innate immune responses (like NF-κB and interferon signaling), metabolic adaptations (particularly mitochondrial function and glycolysis), and ATP/nitric oxide signaling. The review emphasizes how SARS-CoV-2 hijacks host cell machinery for its replication, leading to significant cellular and systemic dysregulation.",

    "conclusions": "SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19 by entering host cells and reprogramming intracellular machinery, leading to widespread cellular and metabolic adaptations that favor viral replication. The virus manipulates various signaling pathways, including calcium, immune, and metabolic pathways, to evade host defenses and promote its own propagation. Understanding these intracellular processes is crucial for explaining the diverse clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and for developing effective therapeutic strategies.",
    "impact_statement": "This review provides a foundational understanding of SARS-CoV-2's intracellular mechanisms of infection and host cell reprogramming, crucial for developing targeted therapies and interventions against COVID-19."
