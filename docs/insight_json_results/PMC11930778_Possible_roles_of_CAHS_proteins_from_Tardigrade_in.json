    "summary_full": "This study investigates the role of cytoplasmic abundant heat soluble (CAHS) proteins from tardigrades in conferring osmotic stress tolerance to mammalian cells. Tardigrades are known for their anhydrobiosis (survival of extreme dehydration), and CAHS proteins are believed to play a protective role. The researchers expressed several CAHS proteins (CAHS1, CAHS3, CAHS8, CAHS12) and other related proteins (LEAM, MAHS) in HeLa cells and observed their subcellular localization under hyperosmotic stress induced by sorbitol or sodium chloride. They found that CAHS1, CAHS3, and CAHS8 expression enhanced the resilience of HeLa cells to hyperosmotic stress, as evidenced by increased cell viability and reduced cell death. The CAHS proteins showed reversible aggregation into granular and filamentous structures in response to osmotic stress. These findings suggest that CAHS proteins could be utilized as cryoprotectants.",
