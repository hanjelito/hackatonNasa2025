    "summary_full": "This study characterized the viable microbiome of the International Space Station (ISS) and compared it to Earth-based cleanrooms. Samples from the ISS and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) cleanrooms were analyzed using cultivation, ATP assays, and PMA-qPCR, along with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The dominant bacterial phyla on the ISS were Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria, with Actinobacteria being predominant on the ISS and Proteobacteria in the cleanrooms. Human skin-associated microorganisms, such as Corynebacterium and Propionibacterium, were found to be significant contributors to the ISS microbiome, unlike in Earth-based cleanrooms where Staphylococcus was less prevalent. The study highlights the value of measuring viable cell diversity for identifying areas needing targeted cleaning and provides a baseline for future ISS microbiome stability studies and astronaut health improvements.",
    "key_findings": [
        "The ISS microbiome is significantly different from Earth-based cleanroom microbiomes, with Actinobacteria (e.g., Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium) being dominant on the ISS, likely due to human habitation.",
        "Proteobacteria were more abundant in Earth-based cleanroom samples compared to ISS samples.",
        "Propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment effectively reduced the detection of non-viable cells, allowing for a more accurate assessment of the viable bacterial community.",
        "While traditional cultivation methods identified Bacillus and Staphylococcus as dominant on the ISS, next-generation sequencing revealed a higher diversity and abundance of Actinobacteria.",
        "Fungal diversity was also location-specific, with ISS samples showing more Eurotiomycetes, Saccharomycetes, and Exobasidiomycetes members compared to cleanroom samples."
