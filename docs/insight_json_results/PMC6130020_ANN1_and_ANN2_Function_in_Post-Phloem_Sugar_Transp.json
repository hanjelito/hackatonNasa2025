    "summary_full": "This study investigates the roles of Arabidopsis annexins ANN1 and ANN2 in primary root growth, focusing on their involvement in post-phloem sugar transport. Mutant seedlings lacking ANN1 and ANN2 exhibited reduced primary root growth and altered root cap development, which were rescued by exogenous sugars. These mutants also showed increased photosynthetic gene expression and chlorophyll accumulation in cotyledons, suggesting sugar starvation in the roots. Analysis revealed higher sugar content in the roots of mutant seedlings, but impaired diffusion of a phloem-mobile probe (CFDA) to the root tips, indicating a defect in post-phloem transport. Increased ROS and callose levels were observed in the root tips of mutants, which could restrict plasmodesmatal transport. The findings suggest that ANN1 and ANN2 are crucial for efficient sugar transport from the phloem unloading zone to the root tip, indirectly influencing photosynthetic rates in cotyledons and overall root growth.",

    "conclusions": "ANN1 and ANN2 play a critical role in facilitating post-phloem sugar transport to the root tip in Arabidopsis. Their absence leads to impaired sugar diffusion, resulting in root growth inhibition and altered root cap development. This sugar deficiency in the root tip triggers a feedback mechanism that upregulates photosynthesis in the cotyledons. The study expands the known functions of annexins to include a significant role in sugar transport regulation.",
    "impact_statement": "This research reveals a novel mechanism by which annexin proteins regulate sugar transport to root tips, impacting plant growth and potentially offering targets for improving crop yield and stress tolerance."
