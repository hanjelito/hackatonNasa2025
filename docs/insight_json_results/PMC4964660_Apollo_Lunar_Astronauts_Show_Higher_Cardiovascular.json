    "summary_full": "This study investigated whether mortality rates due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) differ among astronauts based on their spaceflight experience. Comparing non-flight astronauts, low Earth orbit (LEO) astronauts, and Apollo lunar astronauts (who traveled beyond Earth's magnetosphere), the researchers found no significant difference in CVD mortality between non-flight and LEO groups. However, Apollo lunar astronauts exhibited a CVD mortality rate 4-5 times higher than both non-flight and LEO astronauts. To explore a potential mechanism, the study also examined the long-term effects of simulated weightlessness and space-relevant total-body irradiation on vascular responsiveness in mice. Results indicated that space-relevant irradiation induces sustained vascular endothelial cell dysfunction, a known precursor to occlusive artery disease, suggesting deep space radiation as a significant risk factor for CVD among astronauts.",

    "conclusions": "Apollo lunar astronauts, the only humans to have traveled beyond Earth's magnetosphere, exhibit a significantly higher mortality rate due to cardiovascular disease compared to astronauts who remained in low Earth orbit or never flew. This elevated risk is likely attributable to deep space radiation, which has been shown in animal models to induce long-lasting vascular endothelial cell dysfunction, a key factor in the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. These findings highlight the substantial cardiovascular health risks associated with deep space travel.",
    "impact_statement": "This study provides critical evidence linking deep space radiation exposure to increased cardiovascular disease mortality in astronauts, posing a significant health challenge for future long-duration space missions."
