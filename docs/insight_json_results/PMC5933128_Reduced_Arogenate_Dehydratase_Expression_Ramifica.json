    "summary_full": "This study investigates the effects of modulating arogenate dehydratase (ADT) expression in Arabidopsis thaliana on secondary metabolism and photosynthesis. ADT catalyzes the final step in phenylalanine biosynthesis. ADT-deficient mutants showed reduced lignin content and significant alterations in secondary metabolites, including decreased flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, lignans, and glucosinolates, alongside increased galactolipids and apocarotenoids. Photosynthetic analysis revealed that reduced carbon flux into phenylalanine biosynthesis impairs ATP consumption, leading to an increased ATP/ADP ratio, transient starch overaccumulation, and lower photosynthetic electron transport rates. This reduction in electron transport is attributed to an increased proton motive force across the thylakoid membrane, down-regulating photosystem II activity via high-energy quenching. Respiration and carbon fixation rates did not show significant differences between wild-type and mutant plants. The findings highlight the interconnectedness of ADT activity, secondary metabolism, and photosynthesis, suggesting potential implications for plant improvement strategies.",

    "conclusions": "Modulating arogenate dehydratase expression in Arabidopsis significantly impacts secondary metabolism and photosynthetic efficiency. Reduced phenylalanine biosynthesis leads to decreased phenylpropanoid-derived compounds and glucosinolates, while also affecting photosynthetic electron transport through altered ATP utilization and proton motive force. These findings reveal complex metabolic interdependencies and suggest that ADT activity is a crucial node connecting primary and secondary metabolism with photosynthesis, offering potential targets for metabolic engineering.",
