    "summary_full": "This study investigates the effects of mitochondrion-targeted hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor, AP39, on lifespan and healthspan in Caenorhabditis elegans. The research compares AP39 with an untargeted H2S donor (NaGYY4137) administered from larval stages or during adulthood. Results show that low doses of AP39 administered from birth extend both lifespan and healthspan, maintaining mitochondrial integrity and neuromuscular function. Notably, AP39 administered during adulthood also significantly extends healthspan, even when aging-related cellular dysfunction is already present. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that adult-onset AP39 treatment rejuvenates aging transcriptomes by preserving mitochondrial, cytoskeletal, and peroxisomal gene expression, regulated by the elt-6/elt-3 transcription factor circuit. The study concludes that mitochondrial sulfide augmentation is a promising therapeutic strategy for healthy aging, particularly when administered in adulthood.",

    "conclusions": "Mitochondrial sulfide augmentation, particularly with the targeted donor AP39, is a potent strategy for extending healthspan in C. elegans. The mechanisms differ between developmental and adult-onset treatments, with adult administration rejuvenating aging transcriptomes via the elt-6/elt-3 circuit and preserving mitochondrial, cytoskeletal, and peroxisomal functions. These findings suggest mitochondrial sulfide is a viable therapeutic target for promoting healthy aging, with potential for translation to mammals.",
