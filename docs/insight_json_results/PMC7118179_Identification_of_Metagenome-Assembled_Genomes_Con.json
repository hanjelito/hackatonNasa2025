    "document_title": "Identification of Metagenome-Assembled Genomes Containing Antimicrobial Resistance Genes, Isolated from an Advanced Water Treatment Facility",
    "summary_full": "This study identifies 95 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) that contain antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) from samples taken before microfiltration in an advanced wastewater reclamation facility. These MAGs were not abundant after filtration, suggesting they are removed by the process. The research utilized DNA extraction from filtered water and biofilms, followed by sequencing and bioinformatic analysis including assembly, binning, and ARG identification using DeepARG. The identified MAGs represent a diverse range of bacteria, including some previously uncharacterized lineages. The study highlights the presence of ARGs in microbial communities within water treatment facilities and provides a resource for understanding ARG dissemination. Future work will further characterize these ARGs and investigate the role of non-ARG-containing MAGs in facility operation.",

    "conclusions": "The study successfully identified and characterized 95 MAGs containing ARGs from an advanced water treatment facility, providing a valuable resource for the water treatment community. The findings indicate that microfiltration effectively reduces the abundance of these ARG-carrying microbes. Further research is needed to fully understand the ARGs and the role of other microbial communities in the facility.",
