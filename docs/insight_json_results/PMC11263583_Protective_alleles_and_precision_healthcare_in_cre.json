    "summary_full": "This review explores the potential of identifying and utilizing naturally occurring human genetic alleles with protective effects to enhance astronaut health during deep space missions. It highlights how understanding these alleles, which are linked to decreased cancer risk and improved bone, muscular, and cardiovascular health, could inform personalized nutrition, exercise, and health recommendations. The paper discusses examples of such alleles found in various human cohorts and their relevance to spaceflight challenges like radiation exposure and bone demineralization. It also addresses significant technical and ethical challenges associated with studying these alleles and translating findings into practical applications for aerospace medicine, ultimately aiming to improve crew safety and well-being.",
