    "summary_full": "This study investigates the feasibility of using Chlamydomonas reinhardtii microalgae for biological life support systems in spaceflight. The researchers developed a method using breathable plastic tissue culture bags compatible with the International Space Station's Veggie plant growth chamber, demonstrating robust growth and the ability to store cultures for at least one month. To identify genes crucial for growth in this environment, they employed a competitive growth assay with ultraviolet (UVC) light-induced mutations. Genome sequencing revealed that UVC mutagenesis enriched for transversions and non-synonymous mutations. Genes under positive selection were primarily involved in information processing, including DNA repair, RNA processing, translation, cytoskeletal motors, kinases, and ABC transporters. These findings suggest that modifications in DNA repair, signal transduction, and metabolite transport pathways may be necessary to optimize algal growth for spaceflight applications.",
