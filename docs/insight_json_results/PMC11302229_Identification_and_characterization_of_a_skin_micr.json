    "summary_full": "This study investigates the existence and function of a skin microbiome on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Using a modified microbiome (mCeMbio) and a novel micro-swabbing tool, researchers identified distinct skin- and gut-resident bacterial communities. They found that certain bacteria, like Enterobacter sp. JUb101, primarily colonize the nematode's cuticle, while others, such as Stenotrophomonas indicatrix JUb19, are more prevalent in the gut. The study demonstrates that this skin microbiome enhances the host's cuticle integrity, providing protection against harsh environmental conditions. This work establishes C. elegans as a model for skin microbiome research and highlights the importance of ecologically relevant microbial communities in host fitness.",
