    "summary_full": "The giant muscle protein UNC-89 in C. elegans is crucial for sarcomere organization and locomotion. This study investigates a specific \"interkinase\" (IK) region within UNC-89, which is conserved in mammalian homologs like obscurin and SPEG. Using single-molecule force spectroscopy, the researchers found that a significant portion of the UNC-89 IK region (571 residues) behaves as an entropic spring, characteristic of a random coil. To assess its in vivo function, they created nematodes with an in-frame deletion of this IK region using CRISPR/Cas9. These mutant animals exhibited severe disorganization of sarcomeres in body wall muscle, with abnormal A-band structures observed via super-resolution microscopy. Consequently, these nematodes showed defective locomotion and reduced muscle force generation. An additional HA tag introduced for tracking purposes, while not affecting body wall muscle organization, reduced UNC-89 isoform levels and caused defects in pharyngeal muscle, small body size, and reduced muscle force, likely due to impaired nutritional uptake.",

    "conclusions": "The interkinase region of UNC-89, characterized by its random coil and entropic spring properties, is essential for the proper organization and stability of sarcomeres in C. elegans muscle. Its deletion leads to significant structural defects, impaired locomotion, and reduced muscle force generation, highlighting its critical role in maintaining muscle integrity.",
