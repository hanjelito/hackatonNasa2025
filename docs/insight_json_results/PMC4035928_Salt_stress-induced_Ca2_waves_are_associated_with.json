    "summary_full": "This study investigates a previously unreported plant-wide signaling system involving rapid, long-distance transmission of calcium (Ca2+) waves. When localized salt stress is applied to the root tip of Arabidopsis thaliana, Ca2+ waves propagate through the cortical and endodermal cell layers at speeds up to 400 µm/s. This Ca2+ wave system is dependent on the vacuolar ion channel TPC1 and correlates with the triggering of molecular responses in distant shoot tissues, suggesting a mechanism for rapid integration of environmental stress information throughout the plant. The findings indicate that plants possess a sensory network utilizing ion fluxes for rapid information transmission, akin to a non-nervous system.",

    "conclusions": "Localized salt stress in plant roots elicits a rapid, long-distance Ca2+ wave that propagates through specific cell layers and triggers systemic molecular responses in the shoot. This signaling pathway is dependent on the vacuolar ion channel TPC1, and its efficiency correlates with whole-plant salt tolerance. These findings reveal a novel mechanism for rapid plant-wide communication and integration of environmental stress signals.",
