    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of a 35-day spaceflight mission on gene expression profiles in the mouse brain. Using NanoString technology, researchers analyzed gene expression in mice that traveled to the International Space Station (ISS) and compared them to ground controls. They identified 54 differentially expressed genes that significantly distinguished the two groups. The study found alterations in pathways related to cellular stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolism. Notably, genes involved in oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin sheath maintenance were downregulated, suggesting potential impacts on neuronal support and function. Additionally, genes related to anti-viral signaling, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and bacterial immune response were downregulated, while genes associated with cellular stress and DNA damage were upregulated. The findings suggest that spaceflight induces significant changes in immune reactions, stress responses, and neuronal function, potentially impacting brain health.",

    "conclusions": "Spaceflight significantly alters gene expression profiles in the mouse brain, impacting neuronal function, support cells, and immune responses. The observed downregulation of genes related to neuronal plasticity, myelin maintenance, and innate immunity, coupled with the upregulation of stress-related genes, suggests a complex interplay of adaptive and detrimental responses to the space environment. These changes may have long-term implications for brain health and function.",
