    "summary_full": "This study analyzes the genome of Euprymna scolopes, a model cephalopod, to understand the evolution of specialized symbiotic organs. The researchers found large-scale genomic reorganizations compared to ancestral bilaterian genomes. They identified distinct evolutionary signatures in the light organ (LO) and the accessory nidamental gland (ANG). The LO appears to have evolved through subfunctionalization of genes also found in the eye, suggesting a deep evolutionary link. In contrast, the ANG is enriched with novel, species-specific orphan genes, indicating a different evolutionary strategy. This research provides the first genomic insights into the evolution of multiple symbiotic organs within a single animal host, highlighting different mechanisms of genomic innovation.",

    "conclusions": "The genome of Euprymna scolopes reveals significant genomic reorganization preceding cephalopod radiation, contributing to their unique body plan. Distinct evolutionary patterns in the light organ (LO) and accessory nidamental gland (ANG) highlight different mechanisms of genomic innovation for symbiotic organ evolution. The LO evolved through gene duplication and subfunctionalization linked to eye genes, while the ANG evolved through the acquisition of novel, species-specific genes.",
