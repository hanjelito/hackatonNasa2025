    "summary_full": "This study investigated whether space flight alters the antibiotic susceptibility of Bacillus subtilis. Cells were cultivated on the International Space Station (FL samples) and under matched ground control conditions (GC samples). Using phenotype microarray (PM) screening against 72 antibiotics and growth inhibitors, only 9 compounds showed significant differences between FL and GC samples. However, subsequent standard broth dilution assays did not reveal statistically significant differences in the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) for any of the tested compounds. The findings suggest that space flight causes minimal alterations in the susceptibility of B. subtilis to a broad range of antibiotics and growth inhibitors, contrary to some previous suggestions.",

        "Phenotype microarray screening identified 9 out of 72 tested compounds that showed statistically significant differences in susceptibility between space-flown (FL) and ground control (GC) Bacillus subtilis samples.",
        "Of the 9 compounds, FL samples showed increased resistance to 3 (enoxacin, 6-mercaptopurine, trifluoperazine) and decreased resistance (increased sensitivity) to 6 (lomefloxacin, nalidixic acid, penimepicycline, rolitetracycline, cesium chloride, manganese(II) chloride).",
        "Standard broth dilution assays to determine 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) for 10 selected antibiotics revealed no statistically significant differences between FL and GC samples.",
        "The dramatic difference in resistance to enoxacin observed in PM screening was not replicated in broth dilution assays, suggesting potential assay-specific effects or minimal biological impact.",
        "The study concludes that space flight causes minimal alterations in the phenotypic response of B. subtilis cells to antibiotic susceptibility."

    "conclusions": "The study indicates that space flight, under the conditions tested, does not significantly alter the antibiotic susceptibility of Bacillus subtilis. While some minor differences were detected by phenotype microarray screening, these were not confirmed by more rigorous broth dilution assays, suggesting that concerns about increased antibiotic resistance in bacteria during space missions may be overstated for this organism.",
    "impact_statement": "This research addresses a critical concern for long-duration space missions by demonstrating that Bacillus subtilis does not develop significant antibiotic resistance when grown in space, potentially easing concerns for astronaut health."
