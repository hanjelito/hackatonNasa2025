    "summary_full": "This review explores the profound impact of microgravity, a key stressor in spaceflight, on the intricate homeostasis between eukaryotic hosts (plants and animals) and their associated microbial communities (microbiomes). Microgravity can alter host-microbe interactions at genetic and physiological levels, potentially disrupting essential functions like metabolic and immune responses. The paper discusses how disruptions to environmental parameters in space can affect microbiome resilience, potentially leading to disease. It examines the effects of microgravity on both pathogenic and mutualistic associations in animals, noting increased virulence in some pathogens like Salmonella typhimurium, while others show decreased virulence in specific contexts. The review also details how microgravity affects the development of mutualistic symbiosis, using the squid-Vibrio fischeri model, where processes like hemocyte trafficking and epithelial apoptosis are altered. For plants, microgravity can increase susceptibility to pathogens and impact rhizosphere microbiome structure. The paper highlights the importance of understanding these interactions for maintaining host health during long-duration spaceflights and for developing future life support systems.",
