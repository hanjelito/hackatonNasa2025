    "summary_full": "This paper outlines the critical role of microbial biotechnologies in achieving sustainable human space exploration, focusing on in situ resource utilization (ISRU) and loop-closure to reduce reliance on Earth-based resources. It highlights applications such as habitat air bioremediation, human waste processing, food production, pharmaceutical synthesis, biomining, structural biomanufacturing, energy collection and storage, recycling of waste streams, and soil remediation. The authors emphasize that developing these microbial technologies for space will also yield significant benefits for terrestrial environmental issues, supporting the UN Sustainable Development Goals. The paper identifies key technological needs, including specialized bioreactors and a better understanding of microbial behavior in space environments, and calls for increased research and funding to advance these technologies.",
