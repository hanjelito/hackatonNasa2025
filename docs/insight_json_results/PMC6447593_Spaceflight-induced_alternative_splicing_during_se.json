    "summary_full": "This study investigates the impact of spaceflight on alternative splicing (AS) in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. Analyzing RNA sequencing data from the APEX03 experiment, researchers compared seedlings grown on the International Space Station (ISS) with ground controls. They developed a bioinformatics pipeline to detect differential AS events, identifying changes in transcript isoform expression levels induced by spaceflight. The study provides the first evidence that AS plays a role in the molecular adaptation of plants to the spaceflight environment, affecting gene expression at the isoform level. While specific functional pathways were not immediately apparent, the findings suggest that AS is a crucial component of the plant's response to microgravity and radiation.",
