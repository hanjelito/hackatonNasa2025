    "summary_full": "This study investigated how biological sex and sex steroid hormones influence muscle atrophy in male and female rats exposed to simulated microgravity (0g) and partial gravity (0.4g) for 28 days. Rats underwent either castration/ovariectomy or sham surgeries. Results showed that females experienced greater losses in muscle size and strength (dorsiflexion, plantar flexion) compared to males in both 0g and 0.4g conditions. These sex-based differences persisted even after gonadectomy, suggesting they are not solely dependent on sex steroid hormones. The findings indicate that females may be more susceptible to musculoskeletal aberrations in reduced gravity environments, potentially requiring sex-specific interventions for astronauts.",

        "While males showed some increases in dorsiflexion parameters in 0g, females consistently lost more plantar flexion power in both 0g and 0.4g conditions.",
        "The study suggests that females may require additional or tailored interventions to mitigate musculoskeletal loss during spaceflight."

    "conclusions": "Female rats experience greater muscle size and strength loss compared to males in simulated micro- and partial-gravity environments, and these differences are independent of sex steroid hormones. This suggests that females may be inherently more susceptible to musculoskeletal deconditioning in reduced gravity, necessitating the development of sex-specific countermeasures for astronauts.",
