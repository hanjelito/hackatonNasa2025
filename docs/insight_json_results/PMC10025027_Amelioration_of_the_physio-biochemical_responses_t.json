    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effectiveness of hydropriming, halopriming, and osmopriming in mitigating the negative impacts of salinity stress (100 mM NaCl) on cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis) seed germination and seedling development. Salinity significantly reduced germination, growth, and photosynthetic attributes while increasing reactive oxygen species. Priming treatments, particularly with PEG, thiourea, and proline, effectively counteracted these effects by boosting germination indices, seedling growth, photosynthetic pigments, protein, and proline content, while reducing oxidative damage (MDA content). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that PEG treatments yielded the highest germination indices, and cluster analysis grouped treatments based on their effectiveness. The findings demonstrate that seed priming is a valuable strategy to enhance cauliflower's tolerance to salinity stress, improving its survival and performance in salt-affected agricultural environments.",

    "conclusions": "Seed priming, using hydro-, halo-, and osmopriming techniques with agents like water, NaCl, PEG, proline, and thiourea, significantly improves germination and morpho-physiological traits of cauliflower under salt stress. These benefits are linked to increased proline accumulation, reduced MDA levels, and enhanced photosynthetic pigments and protein content, making priming a cost-effective and sustainable strategy for cultivating cauliflower in saline environments.",
    "impact_statement": "This study provides a practical and cost-effective method (seed priming) to enhance cauliflower's resilience to salinity, crucial for food security in salt-affected agricultural lands."
