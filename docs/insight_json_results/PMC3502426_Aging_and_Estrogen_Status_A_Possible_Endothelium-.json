    "summary_full": "This study investigated the relationship between aging, estrogen status, and bone loss in female Fischer-344 rats. Researchers examined endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the principal nutrient artery (PNA) and trabecular bone volume (BV/TV) in young and old rats with varying estrogen levels (intact, ovariectomized (OVX), and OVX with estrogen replacement). In young rats, OVX reduced vasodilation and bone volume, which were restored by estrogen. In old rats, OVX did not affect vasodilation or bone volume, but estrogen replacement increased both. Crucially, in old rats with low endogenous estrogen, vasodilation was directly correlated with bone volume, suggesting a vascular coupling mechanism in bone remodeling. The findings indicate that estrogen influences both vascular endothelial function and bone volume, and that impaired vasodilation may contribute to age-related bone loss.",

    "conclusions": "Estrogen status significantly impacts endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the femoral principal nutrient artery and trabecular bone volume in young rats, with these effects being reversible by estrogen replacement. In old rats, while ovariectomy alone had less impact, estrogen replacement still enhanced both vascular function and bone volume. The strong correlation between vasodilation and bone volume in low-estrogen conditions suggests a vascular coupling mechanism that links endothelial function to bone remodeling, potentially contributing to age-related bone loss.",
