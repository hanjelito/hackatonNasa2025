    "summary_full": "This paper introduces KatharoSeq, a novel high-throughput protocol designed to overcome the challenges of analyzing microbial communities in low-biomass samples. Traditional methods often yield erroneous results due to contamination and low efficiency. KatharoSeq integrates laboratory and bioinformatic techniques, including the use of positive and negative controls throughout the process, to accurately detect microbial signals from as few as 50 to 500 cells. The protocol was successfully applied to three distinct low-biomass environments: a spacecraft assembly facility (SAF), a hospital neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and an abalone-rearing facility. The study demonstrates KatharoSeq's ability to differentiate true microbial signals from background noise, enabling reliable microbiome analysis in previously difficult-to-study niches.",
