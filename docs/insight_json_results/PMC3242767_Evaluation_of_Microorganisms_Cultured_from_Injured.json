    "summary_full": "This study investigated the microbial communities associated with injured and repressed tissue regeneration sites in the endangered Ozark Hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis bishopi) to identify potential causative agents for their population decline. The researchers cultured and identified bacteria and fungi from abnormal and uninjured tissues of six hellbenders. While many isolates were common environmental organisms, several opportunistic pathogens, including Aeromonas hydrophila (a known amphibian pathogen), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, were found exclusively on injured tissues. Fungal genera such as Penicillium, Fusarium, and Cladosporium were also identified. The lack of a single consistent pathogen across all samples suggests a multifactorial cause for the observed abnormalities and poor regeneration, potentially involving a combination of opportunistic pathogens and environmental stressors like habitat degradation and increased recreational use. This is the first study to profile the external microbial consortia of a Cryptobranchid salamander, providing insights into amphibian population declines.",

    "conclusions": "The study identified several opportunistic pathogens associated with injured tissues of the endangered Ozark Hellbender, but no single organism was consistently isolated from all wounds. This suggests that the observed abnormalities and repressed tissue regeneration are likely due to a combination of factors, including environmental degradation, potential introduction of pathogens by other species, and possibly a compromised immune system in the hellbenders. The findings highlight the complexity of amphibian population declines and the need for further investigation into multifactorial causes.",
    "impact_statement": "This research provides crucial insights into the microbial factors potentially contributing to the decline of the endangered Ozark Hellbender, informing conservation efforts for this species and potentially other declining amphibian populations."
