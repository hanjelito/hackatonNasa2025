    "summary_full": "This study investigated the formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms on stainless steel (SS316 and passivated SS316) and lubricant-impregnated surfaces (LIS) in spaceflight (microgravity) compared to Earth-based conditions. Biofilms in microgravity were found to be less robust, with significantly reduced biomass, thickness, and surface area coverage compared to those grown on Earth. The LIS material demonstrated a strong inhibition of biofilm formation, an effect that was even more pronounced in microgravity than on Earth. Transcriptomic analysis revealed differences in gene expression between the surfaces and gravitational conditions, suggesting potential mechanisms for biofilm reduction on LIS, including altered expression of genes related to virulence factors like pyochelin and rhamnolipids, and possible repulsion by immobilized nucleic acids on the LIS surface. The findings highlight LIS as a promising strategy for controlling bacterial biofilms in spacecraft.",
