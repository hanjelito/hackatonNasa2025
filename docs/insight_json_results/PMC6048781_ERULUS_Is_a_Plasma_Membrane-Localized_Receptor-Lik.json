    "summary_full": "This study investigates the function and localization of the ERULUS (ERU) protein, a receptor-like kinase involved in root hair growth. Contrary to previous models suggesting ERU's role in ammonium homeostasis and tonoplast localization, this research demonstrates that ERU is localized to the plasma membrane (PM) at the root hair tip. The study shows that ERU-GFP fusion proteins complement the short root hair phenotype of the eru-3 mutant and accumulate at the PM and post-Golgi/endocytic vesicles during rapid tip growth. Furthermore, the paper challenges the notion that ERU loss-of-function mutants lack tip-focused cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]cyt) gradients. Instead, it reveals that eru-3 mutants exhibit compromised tip-focused [Ca2+]cyt oscillations, characterized by lower frequency and higher amplitude. These findings suggest that ERU's primary role is to maintain normal [Ca2+]cyt oscillations, which are crucial for sustained root hair tip growth, rather than mediating ammonium homeostasis.",
