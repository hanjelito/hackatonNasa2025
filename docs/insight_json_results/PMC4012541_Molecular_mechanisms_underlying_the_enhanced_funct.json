    "summary_full": "This study investigates the molecular mechanisms behind the improved and sustained functions of hepatocytes cultured in three-dimensional (3D) aggregates compared to traditional monolayer cultures. Primary mouse hepatocytes were cultured in rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactors (3D aggregates) or on tissue culture dishes (TCDs, monolayers). Gene expression analysis revealed that genes upregulated in 3D culture were distinct from those seen during liver development or regeneration, instead representing a diverse array of hepatocyte-specific functional genes. Promoter analysis indicated a significant over-representation of hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (Hnf4a) binding sites in these upregulated genes. Hnf4a expression and many of its downstream targets were increased in RWV cultures, while mesenchymal and cytoskeletal genes, induced in TCDs, were suppressed in RWVs. These findings highlight the importance of 3D cell-cell interactions in maintaining fundamental molecular pathways of hepatocyte function, suggesting a basis for designing biomaterials to optimize hepatocyte functions ex vivo for biomedical applications.",
