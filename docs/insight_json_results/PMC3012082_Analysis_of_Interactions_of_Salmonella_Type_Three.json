    "summary_full": "This study investigates the role of Salmonella enterica Type Three Secretion Systems (T3SSs) in intestinal epithelial cell invasion and intracellular replication using a 3-D organotypic model of human intestinal epithelium. Contrary to the prevailing paradigm based on monolayer cell cultures, the Salmonella SPI-1 T3SS was found to be dispensable for invasion into these 3-D intestinal cells. Furthermore, Salmonella strains with single, double, or complete T3SS knockouts (SPI-1, SPI-2, SPI-1/2, and SPI-1/SPI-2: flhDC) also invaded the 3-D cells to wildtype levels, indicating that T3SSs are not required for invasion. Invasion was confirmed to be an active bacterial process, not due to non-specific uptake. The study also found that T3SS mutants did not preferentially target specific cell types within the 3-D aggregates, including M-cells, enterocytes, or Paneth cells. However, each T3SS was found to be necessary for substantial intracellular bacterial replication. These findings suggest that T3SSs are dispensable for invasion but crucial for intracellular growth, mirroring in vivo observations and highlighting the utility of 3-D models for predicting pathogenic mechanisms.",

    "conclusions": "The study concludes that Salmonella T3SSs are dispensable for invasion into highly differentiated 3-D human intestinal epithelial cells, a finding that contrasts with established knowledge from monolayer models. However, these T3SSs are crucial for significant intracellular bacterial replication. The 3-D organotypic model used in this study demonstrates infection phenotypes that closely mimic in vivo observations, highlighting its utility in predicting pathogenic mechanisms and advancing the understanding of Salmonella enteropathogenesis.",
    "impact_statement": "This research refines our understanding of Salmonella pathogenesis by demonstrating the limitations of traditional cell culture models and validating the utility of 3-D intestinal models for studying host-pathogen interactions, potentially leading to improved strategies for combating enteric infections."
