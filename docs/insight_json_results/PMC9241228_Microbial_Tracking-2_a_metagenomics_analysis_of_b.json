    "document_title": "Microbial Tracking-2, a metagenomics analysis of bacteria and fungi onboard the International Space Station",
    "summary_full": "The Microbial Tracking 2 (MT-2) project analyzed the surface microbiome of the International Space Station (ISS) over a 14-month period, building upon the previous MT-1 study. Using shotgun metagenomics on both total DNA and viable cells (PMA-treated), alongside culture methods, the study characterized bacterial and fungal communities across eight locations. Results showed that the ISS surface microbiome is dominated by human-associated organisms, primarily Staphylococcus and Malassezia species. While temporal changes in microbial populations were observed between sampling flights, no significant spatial differences were found across locations. The antimicrobial resistance gene profiles remained stable over the 5-year span of MT-1 and MT-2, with macrolide/lincosamide/streptogramin resistance being the most widespread. Metagenomic assembled genomes (MAGs) revealed a functional propensity for amino acid utilization over carbohydrate metabolism. Co-occurrence analyses indicated strong associations between bacterial and fungal genera, suggesting complex microbial interactions. The findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the ISS surface microbiome, informing policies for astronaut health and spacecraft integrity.",
