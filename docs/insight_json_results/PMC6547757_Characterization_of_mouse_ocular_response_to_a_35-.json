    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of a 35-day spaceflight mission on mouse ocular tissues, focusing on the retina and blood-retinal barrier (BRB). Mice exposed to spaceflight showed increased apoptosis in retinal vascular endothelial cells and photoreceptors. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed increased expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1), and a tendency for decreased expression of Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), indicating disruption of BRB integrity. Proteomic analysis identified significant alterations in proteins and pathways related to cell death, cell cycle, immune response, mitochondrial function, and metabolic stress in the flight group compared to ground controls. Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements showed a significant decrease in post-flight readings for the left eye, which the authors suggest may not be biologically significant and could be due to the time delay between return and measurement, or insufficient BRB disruption to elevate IOP in mice.",

    "conclusions": "This study demonstrates that 35 days of spaceflight leads to retinal cell death and compromises the integrity of the blood-retinal barrier in mice. Proteomic analysis reveals significant changes in pathways associated with cellular stress and function. These findings suggest that spaceflight poses a risk for retinal damage and potential long-term visual impairment in astronauts and highlight the need for effective countermeasures.",
