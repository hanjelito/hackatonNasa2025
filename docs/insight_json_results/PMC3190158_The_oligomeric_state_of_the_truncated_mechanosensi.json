    "summary_full": "This study investigates the oligomeric state of the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) from Staphylococcus aureus (SaMscL) in its native membrane environment. Previous studies showed conflicting results regarding SaMscL's stoichiometry, with crystal structures suggesting tetrameric states while other methods indicated pentameric states. Using an in vivo disulfide-trapping technique, the researchers found that both full-length SaMscL and various C-terminally truncated versions, including the one used for the tetrameric crystal structure, exist as pentamers in vivo. This suggests that the C-terminal domain's role in oligomerization is significant only when the protein is solubilized in detergent, not in its native membrane state. Functional assays also showed similar behavior between full-length and truncated channels, supporting their structural similarity in vivo.",

    "conclusions": "The C-terminal domain of S. aureus MscL does not influence its pentameric oligomeric state in vivo. The observed tetrameric structure in a previous crystal study was likely an artifact of detergent solubilization. This highlights the importance of assessing protein structure and stoichiometry in native membrane environments, as detergent conditions can significantly alter protein conformation and assembly.",
