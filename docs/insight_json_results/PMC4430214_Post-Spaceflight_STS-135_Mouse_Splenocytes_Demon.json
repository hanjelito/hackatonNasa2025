    "document_title": "Post-Spaceflight (STS-135) Mouse Splenocytes Demonstrate Altered Activation Properties and Surface Molecule Expression",
    "summary_full": "This study investigated the impact of spaceflight on mouse splenocyte immune function following the STS-135 mission. Splenocytes from mice that underwent a 13-day orbital flight showed distinct changes in phenotypic populations and surface molecule expression compared to ground controls, both immediately post-flight and after in vitro culture. Key alterations included lower expression of CD4+CD25+ and CD8+CD25+ cells, reduced CD11c+MHC II+ populations, and increased CD11c+MHC I+ populations. Flight splenocytes also exhibited enhanced phagocytic activity. Upon stimulation with T-cell mitogens (ConA) or Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists, further differences in cell populations and cytokine production (decreased IFN-γ, increased IL-2 with ConA) were observed, indicating impaired responsiveness that persisted in vitro. The findings suggest that spaceflight conditions significantly affect immune cell surface molecule expression and activation capabilities, with implications for crew health during deep space missions.",

    "conclusions": "Spaceflight significantly alters the expression of surface molecules on mouse splenocytes, affecting both T-cell and dendritic cell populations. These alterations lead to impaired responsiveness to in vitro stimulation, suggesting a persistent dysregulation of the immune system post-flight. These findings highlight the need to understand and address spaceflight-induced immune changes for maintaining crew health during extended missions.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals that spaceflight profoundly impacts mouse immune cell function, providing critical insights into potential risks for astronaut health during long-duration space missions."
