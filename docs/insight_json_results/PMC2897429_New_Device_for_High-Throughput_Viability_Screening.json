    "summary_full": "This paper introduces a novel device, the BioFlux system, designed for high-throughput screening of continuous flow biofilms. Traditional methods for assessing biofilm viability are time-consuming and not suitable for high-throughput applications. The BioFlux device utilizes microfluidic channels within a standard well plate format, allowing for controlled fluid flow and compatibility with plate readers. The study demonstrates that using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing bacteria combined with propidium iodide (PI) staining and plate reader fluorescence measurement provides a rapid and accurate method for determining biofilm viability. This method was validated against traditional plate counts and fluorescence microscopy. The system was successfully used to screen the efficacy of several antimicrobials against Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 flow biofilms, highlighting its utility for drug discovery and biofilm research.",
