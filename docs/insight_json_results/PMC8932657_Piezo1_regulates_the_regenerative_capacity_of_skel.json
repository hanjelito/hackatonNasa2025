    "summary_full": "Muscle stem cells (MuSCs) exhibit morphological heterogeneity with distinct cellular protrusions, which are classified into three functional states: responsive, intermediate, and sensory. The transition between these states is crucial for muscle regeneration and is regulated by the mechanosensing protein Piezo1. Pharmacological activation of Piezo1 can prime MuSCs towards a more responsive state. Conversely, deleting Piezo1 in MuSCs shifts the distribution towards less responsive cells, mimicking defects seen in dystrophic muscles. Reactivating Piezo1 in dystrophic muscles can ameliorate these morphological and regenerative defects. This study advances the understanding of stem cell behavior during injury and identifies Piezo1 as a key regulator of stem cell state adjustments essential for regeneration.",

    "conclusions": "Adult MuSCs exhibit significant morphological heterogeneity, with distinct protrusion patterns defining functional states (responsive, intermediate, sensory) that are dynamically regulated during muscle regeneration. Piezo1 is a key regulator of this heterogeneity and is essential for the proper transition of MuSCs to activated states and for efficient muscle repair. Dysfunctional Piezo1 signaling contributes to the regenerative defects observed in muscular dystrophy, and its pharmacological activation shows therapeutic potential.",
    "impact_statement": "This study identifies Piezo1 as a critical regulator of muscle stem cell behavior, revealing a novel mechanism for controlling muscle regeneration and offering a potential therapeutic target for muscular dystrophy."
