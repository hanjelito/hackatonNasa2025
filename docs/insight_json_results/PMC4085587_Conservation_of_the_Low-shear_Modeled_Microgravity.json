    "summary_full": "This study investigates the conservation of the low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) response across various Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae. Using phenotypic assays, qPCR, and targeted mutations, the researchers found that the LSMMG response is conserved within this family, although the direction of up- or down-regulation of specific responses can vary by genus. The study also examined the role of trp operon genes and the TrpR regulator in the LSMMG response by creating mutations in these genes in S. Typhimurium and E. coli. No significant alteration in the LSMMG response was observed in these mutant strains compared to wild-type. This research provides novel data for several genera and is the first to analyze trp genes in the context of LSMMG responses, contributing to the understanding of how LSMMG affects bacteria and its potential for future bacterial engineering.",

    "conclusions": "The study concludes that the response to low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) is conserved across the Enterobacteriaceae family, indicating shared mechanisms for sensing this environmental signal. However, the direction of phenotypic and gene expression changes can differ between genera. The trp operon genes and the TrpR regulator were found not to be involved in this conserved LSMMG response under the tested conditions. These findings suggest potential for targeted applications of LSMMG in engineering various Enterobacteriaceae.",
