    "summary_full": "This study integrates transcriptomic data from spaceflown mice with a comprehensive knowledge graph (SPOKE) to identify phenotypic changes relevant to human health during spaceflight. By analyzing six NASA GeneLab datasets from various missions and tissues (thymus, liver, spleen), the researchers used a novel method called Fold-Change Enhanced Propagated SPOKE Entry Vectors (PSEVs) to link gene expression changes to higher-order biological concepts and symptoms. This approach successfully identified known spaceflight-related symptoms and physiological changes, such as motion sickness and alterations in blood vessel diameter, and provided a proof-of-concept for using knowledge graphs to bridge the gap between molecular data and observable health effects in space. The findings suggest that this method can help predict potential health risks for astronauts and identify targets for countermeasures.",
