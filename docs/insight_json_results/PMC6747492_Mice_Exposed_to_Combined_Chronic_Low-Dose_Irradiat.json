    "summary_full": "This study investigated the long-term transcriptional effects on the mouse brain following exposure to simulated microgravity (hindlimb unloading, HLU) and/or low-dose gamma irradiation (LDR) for 21 days, followed by a 4-month readaptation period. While single exposures to HLU or LDR resulted in minimal gene expression and methylation changes in the brain after readaptation, the combined HLU+LDR exposure led to significant alterations in pathways related to neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, neuropeptide regulation, and cellular signaling. These findings suggest that the combined stressors of spaceflight-like conditions can induce dynamic neurological readaptation processes involving neuroplasticity and repair, which may ultimately lead to long-term neurological sequelae.",

    "conclusions": "Chronic exposure to combined simulated microgravity and low-dose irradiation induces long-term transcriptional alterations in the mouse brain. While single stressors have minimal impact, the combination triggers dynamic readaptation processes involving neuroplasticity and repair, which may lead to late-onset neurological sequelae. These findings highlight the complex neurological challenges associated with long-duration spaceflight.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals that combined spaceflight stressors can lead to lasting changes in brain function, underscoring the need for countermeasures to protect astronaut neurological health on long-duration missions."
