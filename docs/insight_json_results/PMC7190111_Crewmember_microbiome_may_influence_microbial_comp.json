    "summary_full": "This study investigated the relationship between a single crewmember's microbiome and the microbial composition of International Space Station (ISS) surfaces using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Samples were collected from the crewmember's body (skin, nose, ear, mouth, saliva) at multiple time points pre-, during, and post-flight, alongside environmental surface samples from two different flights. The analysis revealed that the crewmember's skin, nostril, and ear microbiomes were more similar to ISS surfaces than mouth and saliva samples. Notably, skin samples from the crewmember were more closely related to surface samples collected during the same flight. Saliva samples showed a decrease in species diversity during flight, which partially recovered post-flight. SourceTracker analysis indicated that the crewmember's microbiome contributed significantly to the ISS surface microbiome, suggesting an exchange of microbial communities between the crew and their environment. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring crew and ISS microbiomes for long-term space missions.",

    "conclusions": "The study demonstrates a significant interplay between a crewmember's microbiome and the microbial composition of ISS habitable surfaces, with evidence suggesting microbial exchange. Skin and other body sites of the crewmember harbor microbes similar to those found on ISS surfaces, and the crewmember's microbiome contributes substantially to the surface microbiome. Changes in saliva microbiome diversity during flight warrant further investigation for potential health implications. These findings underscore the need for continued microbial surveillance and the development of mitigation strategies for long-duration space missions.",
    "impact_statement": "This research provides crucial insights into the dynamic relationship between astronauts and their microbial environment on the ISS, informing strategies for maintaining crew health and mission success during extended space travel."
