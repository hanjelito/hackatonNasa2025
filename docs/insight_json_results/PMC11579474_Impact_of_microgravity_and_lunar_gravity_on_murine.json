    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of microgravity (MG), lunar gravity (1/6 g), and artificial 1 g on mice housed on the International Space Station for 25-35 days. The research focused on behavioral, skeletal, and immune system responses. Bone density reduction observed in microgravity was largely recovered by 1 g and partially by 1/6 g, with both conditions suppressing microgravity-induced changes in osteoblast and osteoclast gene expression. Thymus atrophy due to microgravity was partially recovered by both 1 g and 1/6 g, though gene expression changes in the thymus were not fully reversed by 1/6 g. While no histological changes were seen in the spleen under low gravity, gene expression alterations were noted. The study found that lunar gravity mitigated microgravity-induced histological changes and partially reversed gene expression changes in the bone and thymus, highlighting organ-specific variations in gravity response and suggesting a potential molecular-level gravity threshold for maintaining health during spaceflight.",

    "conclusions": "Lunar gravity (1/6 g) partially mitigates microgravity-induced histological and gene expression changes in the bone and thymus of mice, though not fully reversing them. The spleen shows a different response, with gene expression changes in microgravity being less influenced by gravity at 1/6 g. These findings highlight organ-specific variations in gravity response and suggest that a specific gravitational threshold exists for maintaining physiological health during space travel, which needs further elucidation for future space exploration.",
    "impact_statement": "This study provides crucial insights into how different gravitational forces affect mammalian physiology, informing strategies to maintain astronaut health during long-duration space missions, particularly to the Moon."
