    "summary_full": "This study investigated the safety and pharmacokinetics of intranasally administered unfractionated heparin (UFH) as a potential prophylactic for COVID-19. In mice, daily intranasal dosing of UFH for 14 days showed no evidence of toxicity, with no significant changes in blood coagulation parameters or minor irritant events compared to controls. In vivo imaging revealed a single-phase clearance of UFH from the nasal cavity, with approximately 3.2% remaining after 12 hours and decaying to background levels by 48 hours. A small-scale human study also demonstrated safety, with no significant changes in activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), international normalized ratio (INR), or platelet count observed. The clearance kinetics suggest potentially protective levels of UFH in the nasal cavity for up to 12 hours post-dosing, indicating a promising non-invasive delivery method for potential antiviral prophylaxis.",

    "conclusions": "Intranasal administration of unfractionated heparin (UFH) is safe and well-tolerated in both mice and humans, with no observed local or systemic adverse effects. The clearance kinetics indicate that UFH can maintain potentially protective concentrations in the nasal cavity for up to 12 hours, suggesting it is a viable non-invasive delivery method for prophylactic use against respiratory viruses like SARS-CoV-2.",
    "impact_statement": "This study demonstrates the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of intranasal heparin, supporting its potential as a non-invasive prophylactic agent against respiratory viral infections, including COVID-19."
