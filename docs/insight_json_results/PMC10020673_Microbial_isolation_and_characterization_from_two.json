    "summary_full": "This study investigated the microbial communities within two flex lines (UPA95 and UPA115) from the Urine Processor Assembly (UPA) on the International Space Station (ISS). These lines were returned to Earth for analysis. Culture and culture-independent methods revealed the presence of bacteria such as Burkholderia, Paraburkholderia, and Leifsonia, and fungi including Fusarium and Lecythophora. Genomic analysis identified five Burkholderia isolates as B. contaminans and two Paraburkholderia isolates as P. fungorum. Notably, unique chromate-resistance gene clusters were found in these isolates, differentiating them from previously studied ISS water system microbes. Environmental scanning electron microscopy provided the first evidence of fungal-bacterial biofilms within these UPA flex lines. The B. contaminans isolates showed significant biofilm formation potential, with their genomes containing gene clusters related to quorum sensing, biofilm formation, antifungal compounds, and hemolysins. Phenotypic assays confirmed biofilm formation, bacterial-fungal interactions, and hemolytic activity. The findings highlight the UPA flex lines as a unique ecological niche for microbial growth and biofilm formation, providing crucial insights for developing engineering controls to prevent biofouling in future space station water systems.",

    "conclusions": "The UPA flex lines represent a unique ecological niche within the ISS Water Recovery System, harboring microbial communities capable of forming biofilms. The isolated bacteria, particularly Burkholderia contaminans, possess genetic adaptations for survival in the harsh UPA environment, including chromate resistance. The presence of biofilms and the genetic potential for producing various secondary metabolites highlight the need for further investigation into these organisms and their interactions to inform the design of effective biofilm prevention strategies for future long-duration space missions.",
