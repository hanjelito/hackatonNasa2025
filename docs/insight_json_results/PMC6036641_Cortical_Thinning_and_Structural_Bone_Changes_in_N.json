    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of a single 10 Gy dose of whole chest radiation on bone structure in 16 male rhesus macaques. The researchers measured bone mineral density (BMD) and cortical thickness (Ct.Th) in thoracic (T9) and lumbar (L2, L4) vertebrae at various time points post-irradiation. They found that younger primates (<50 months at irradiation) experienced greater mortality due to pulmonary toxicity and exhibited significant loss of both Ct.Th and BMD in all measured vertebrae, even those outside the radiation field. Older primates (>50 months) showed rapid loss of Ct.Th and BMD in the irradiated T9 vertebra, but only BMD loss in the out-of-field vertebrae. Histological analysis revealed increased porosity in areas of cortical thinning. The findings suggest that bone is sensitive to high-dose radiation, leading to rapid structural deterioration and potentially increasing fracture risk, with younger individuals being more susceptible.",

    "conclusions": "High-dose, single-fraction whole chest irradiation in non-human primates leads to rapid cortical thinning and bone mineral density loss, particularly in younger animals. These structural changes suggest that bone is radiosensitive and susceptible to fracture following radiation therapy. The findings highlight the importance of considering age at irradiation and the potential for early osteoclast activation in mitigating radiation-induced bone damage.",
    "impact_statement": "This study demonstrates that high-dose radiation significantly damages bone structure in non-human primates, suggesting a need for strategies to protect bone in cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy, especially younger individuals."
