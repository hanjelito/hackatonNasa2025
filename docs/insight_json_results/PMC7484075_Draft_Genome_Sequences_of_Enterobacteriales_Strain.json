    "document_title": "Draft Genome Sequences of Enterobacteriales Strains Isolated from the International Space Station",
    "summary_full": "This study reports the whole-genome sequencing of 26 bacterial strains belonging to the order Enterobacteriales, isolated from various locations on the International Space Station (ISS). These bacteria, including Pantoea brenneri, Pantoea agglomerans, Kalamiella piersonii, and Enterobacter bugandensis, are of interest due to their potential pathogenicity and ability to adapt to the space environment, posing a risk to astronauts. The genome sequences were generated using Illumina sequencing and assembled with SPAdes, with quality assessed by QUAST. The data were annotated using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline. This characterization aims to identify genetic mechanisms related to adaptation and potential pathogenicity, aiding in the development of countermeasures for long-duration space missions.",
