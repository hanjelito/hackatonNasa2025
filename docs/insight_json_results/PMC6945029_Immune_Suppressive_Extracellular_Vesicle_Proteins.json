    "summary_full": "This study investigates the origin and genetic basis of Mixed-Strategy Extracellular Vesicles (MSEVs) produced by the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina heterotoma, which are crucial for suppressing the host Drosophila's immune system. By sequencing the wasp's genome and analyzing its transcriptome and MSEV proteome, the researchers aimed to determine if MSEV proteins are encoded by the wasp genome. They identified 246 additional proteins in the MSEV proteome, bringing the total to 407, and found that over 90% of these proteins have coding regions within the wasp's genomic scaffolds. The analysis also revealed similarities between MSEVs and exosomes, and suggested that while some MSEV proteins show distant similarities to viral proteins, the majority are of wasp origin. These findings support the vertical inheritance of MSEVs and provide insights into the evolution of immune suppression strategies in parasitic wasps.",

    "conclusions": "The study concludes that the majority of proteins comprising the immune-suppressive Mixed-Strategy Extracellular Vesicles (MSEVs) of Leptopilina heterotoma are encoded within the wasp's own nuclear genome. This finding explains the stable association and vertical inheritance of MSEVs. While a viral origin cannot be entirely ruled out due to genome assembly limitations, the evidence strongly favors a cellular origin, with MSEVs exhibiting characteristics similar to exosomes. These results highlight a sophisticated strategy of immune suppression evolved by parasitic wasps.",
