    "document_title": "Draft Genome Sequences of Various Bacterial Phyla Isolated from the International Space Station",
    "summary_full": "This study reports the draft whole-genome sequences of 96 bacterial strains belonging to 14 species, isolated from surfaces of the International Space Station (ISS) during the Microbial Tracking 2 study. The characterization of the ISS microbiome is crucial for monitoring the spread and evolution of potential pathogens, which is vital for astronaut health in this closed environment. The identified bacteria include common human commensals and opportunistic pathogens such as Acinetobacter pittii, Kocuria species, Micrococcus luteus, and various coagulase-negative staphylococci. Other identified species include Cytobacillus horneckiae and Methylobacterium organophilum. Samples were collected across five ISS missions between June 2017 and December 2018 from various locations. Standard DNA extraction, library preparation, and whole-genome shotgun sequencing were performed, followed by assembly and quality assessment using tools like SPAdes and QUAST. Species identification was confirmed using OrthoANIu. The generated genome data has been deposited in GenBank and the NASA GeneLab system.",
