    "summary_full": "This study investigated the combined effects of simulated microgravity, the stress hormone analog isoproterenol, and gamma radiation on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Using rotating-wall vessels (RWVs) to simulate microgravity, researchers found that microgravity alone increased DNA strand breaks. Radiation exposure, particularly at 2 Gy, also induced DNA damage and altered gene expression related to DNA damage response. Notably, radiation-induced cytokine production was observed only in microgravity conditions. Prior treatment with isoproterenol generally prevented or reduced these microgravity- and radiation-induced effects, except for the expression of the ADRB2 gene, where a complex synergistic interaction with radiation and gravity was observed. The findings suggest that RWVs can model space-related immune cell responses and have implications for understanding disease mechanisms and developing countermeasures for astronauts and patients undergoing radiotherapy.",
