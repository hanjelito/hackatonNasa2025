    "document_title": "Biomass Production of the EDEN ISS Space Greenhouse in Antarctica During the 2018 Experiment Phase",
    "summary_full": "The EDEN ISS greenhouse, a space-analog test facility in Antarctica, conducted multidisciplinary research on plant cultivation for future space missions during its 2018 experiment phase. Over nine months, 26 different crops were grown on a 12.5 m² cultivation area, with a focus on lettuce, leafy greens, and fresh vegetables. The facility produced over 268 kg of edible biomass, with cucumbers, lettuces, leafy greens, and tomatoes being the most abundant. Environmental conditions were maintained at specific set points for light, temperature, humidity, and CO2. This paper details the edible and inedible biomass production data for each crop, providing valuable insights for simulation models, cultivar selection, and the Crop Readiness Level evaluation method for space greenhouses.",
