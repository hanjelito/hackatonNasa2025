    "summary_full": "This study investigated the genome-wide gene expression changes in mouse liver and kidney tissues following 12 days of spaceflight, comparing them to ground-based controls. The research aimed to identify common gene expression pathways activated across different tissue types in response to spaceflight stimuli. Using gene array analysis and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), the study found that while there were tissue-specific changes, both liver and kidney tissues commonly overexpressed genes in four key areas: cellular responses to peptides, hormones, and nitrogen compounds; apoptosis and cell death; fat cell differentiation; and negative regulation of protein kinase. Specific pathways like T cell activation were upregulated in the liver but downregulated in the kidney, while pathways related to peptide binding and cell division were upregulated in the kidney and downregulated in the liver. The study highlights both shared and distinct molecular responses of these organs to the spaceflight environment, with significant upregulation of Cdkn1a (a cell cycle inhibitor) observed in both tissues.",

    "conclusions": "Liver and kidney exhibit both shared and distinct gene expression pathway responses to spaceflight stress. Four common pathways were upregulated in both organs: cellular responses to peptides/hormones, apoptosis, fat cell differentiation, and negative regulation of protein kinase. Specific pathways related to T cell activation were prominent in the liver, while pathways like peptide binding and cell division were more affected in the kidney. The study confirms the reliability of using paired tissue analysis from the same animals to minimize confounding factors and provides a foundation for understanding organ-specific and common molecular adaptations to spaceflight.",
