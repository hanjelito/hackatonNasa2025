    "summary_full": "This perspective paper, developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) Topical Team Astrobiology and Astrochemistry, outlines key topics and recommendations for future space experiments in astrobiology and astrochemistry. Building on the success of the International Space Station (ISS), it highlights the potential of emerging platforms like CubeSats, SmallSats, and the Lunar Orbital Gateway. The paper discusses the importance of in situ measurements, experimental parameters, exposure scenarios, and orbits, while identifying knowledge gaps. It covers three main themes: understanding the origins of life, understanding habitability and the limits of life, and understanding the signs of life. The authors emphasize the necessity of space-based experiments to study the complex space environment, including radiation and microgravity, which cannot be fully replicated on Earth. They also provide an outlook for experiments on the Moon and Mars and their role in the search for exoplanets and biosignatures.",
