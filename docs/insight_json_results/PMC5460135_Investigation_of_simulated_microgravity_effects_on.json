    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of simulated microgravity on the oral bacterium Streptococcus mutans, a key contributor to dental caries. Using high aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) to mimic microgravity conditions, researchers compared S. mutans grown under simulated microgravity to those grown under normal gravity. They observed that S. mutans in simulated microgravity showed increased susceptibility to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the late stationary phase, although competence for DNA uptake was unaffected. RNA sequencing revealed significant changes in gene expression, with 153 genes upregulated and 94 genes downregulated by at least twofold in simulated microgravity. These affected genes were involved in carbohydrate metabolism, translation, and stress responses, including genes on extrachromosomal elements. Metabolomic analysis also indicated altered metabolite profiles. The findings suggest that microgravity conditions can alter S. mutans physiology and gene expression, potentially influencing its cariogenic potential during spaceflight.",
