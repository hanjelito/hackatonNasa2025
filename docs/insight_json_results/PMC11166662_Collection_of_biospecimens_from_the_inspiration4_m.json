    "summary_full": "This paper details the comprehensive biospecimen collection and processing procedures established for the SpaceX Inspiration4 mission, forming the foundation for the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA) initiative. Samples were collected longitudinally from four crew members before, during, and after spaceflight, encompassing a wide range of biological materials including blood, saliva, urine, stool, swabs, skin biopsies, and environmental samples. The study outlines robust methods for sample preservation and biobanking to facilitate future molecular analyses, aiming to standardize aerospace medicine research and enhance understanding of spaceflight's impact on human health. The established framework is designed to be scalable and applicable to future commercial and governmental space missions.",

    "conclusions": "The Inspiration4 mission provided a unique opportunity to establish and validate a robust framework for biospecimen collection and biobanking in spaceflight, known as the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA). This standardized approach, encompassing a wide array of sample types and meticulous processing protocols, is crucial for generating high-quality, comparable multi-omic data. The SOMA initiative will significantly advance our understanding of human physiological and microbial responses to spaceflight, paving the way for improved crew health, safety, and performance in future space exploration endeavors.",
