    "summary_full": "This paper proposes the establishment of a routine omics data collection program for European astronauts and spaceflight participants (SFPs) in both space and analog environments. The authors argue that leveraging advancements in omics technologies, similar to their impact on molecular medicine on Earth, can provide crucial mechanistic insights into human physiological changes during spaceflight. This data resource, collected longitudinally and standardized, would enable AI-driven analyses for improved occupational health, personalized medicine approaches, and better risk quantification for future deep-space missions. The paper discusses practical considerations such as data types (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, metagenomics), sampling methods (blood, urine, stool, saliva, swabs, hair, breath), and optimal time points for data collection. It also critically appraises the ethical and legal challenges, particularly concerning the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the need for robust data governance, informed consent, and secure data sharing mechanisms. The authors advocate for a cohesive European approach, potentially through an ESA topical team or workshop, to standardize practices and policies, thereby unlocking the full scientific potential of human space omics research.",
