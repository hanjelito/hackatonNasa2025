    "document_title": "A comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 review, Part 2: host extracellular to systemic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection",
    "summary_full": "This review, the second in a three-part series, focuses on the biological effects of SARS-CoV-2 on post-acute COVID-19, specifically examining tissue and organ adaptations and damage. It synthesizes knowledge from virological, animal, and clinical studies to explain the mechanisms behind varied clinical presentations. The review details how SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts host metabolism, leading to altered circulating metabolites and systemic effects on tissue function and immune state. It also explores changes in humoral factors, including the renin-angiotensin system and endocrine functions, and discusses the role of exosomes in intercellular communication and disease progression. Furthermore, the review highlights the involvement of the non-coding transcriptome (miRNAs, lncRNAs, circRNAs) in regulating viral replication and host responses. Cardiovascular, neurological, gastrointestinal, and immune system adaptations are examined, along with their contribution to acute symptoms and long-term sequelae like Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC) or long COVID-19. The review emphasizes the pleiotropic and dynamic nature of COVID-19, underscoring the need for further research into its complex mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.",

    "conclusions": "SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to a complex, multi-faceted disease (COVID-19) with significant acute and chronic impacts, including Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PASC). The virus profoundly affects host metabolism, humoral factors, the non-coding transcriptome, and multiple organ systems. Understanding these intricate interactions and physiological adaptations is crucial for developing effective treatments and improving patient outcomes, highlighting the need for continued research into the biochemical pathways and systemic effects of the virus.",
