    "document_title": "Editorial: Revisiting the limits of plant life - plant adaptations to extreme terrestrial environments relating to astrobiology and space biology",
    "summary_full": "This editorial discusses the remarkable adaptations of terrestrial plants to extreme environments and their relevance to astrobiology and space biology. It highlights how understanding these adaptations can aid in selecting plants for space missions, developing genetically engineered space food crops, and guiding the search for extraterrestrial life. The editorial summarizes key research presented in a special issue, including studies on plant resistance to cosmic radiation, the benefits of co-culturing crops with endophytic fungi from extreme environments for space cultivation, the challenges of seed germination in extraterrestrial regolith, and the photosynthetic capabilities of cyanobacteria under simulated M-dwarf star light. The overarching theme is the critical role of plant science in enabling long-duration human space exploration and the search for life beyond Earth.",
