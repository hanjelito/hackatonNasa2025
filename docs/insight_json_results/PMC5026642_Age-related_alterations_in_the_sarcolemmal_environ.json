    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of lifelong mild caloric restriction (CR) and CR combined with voluntary wheel running (WR) on age-related changes in the sarcolemmal environment of rat plantaris muscle fibers. Aging led to discontinuous expression of dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) proteins (dystrophin, α-syntrophin, nNOS) and increased membrane repair proteins (MG53, dysferlin, annexins A6 and A2). Conversely, aged muscle showed reduced levels of NADPH oxidase isoform 2 (Nox2) subunits. Lifelong CR and CR+WR interventions significantly protected against DGC disruption and maintained membrane repair proteins near young adult levels. These interventions also prevented the age-related decline in Nox2 subunits. The findings suggest that lifelong CR and WR are effective countermeasures against age-related sarcolemmal alterations, potentially mitigating sarcopenia and improving muscle health.",

    "conclusions": "Lifelong mild caloric restriction and voluntary wheel running are effective countermeasures against age-related alterations in the myofiber membrane environment, including DGC disruption, increased membrane repair protein abundance, and reduced Nox2 subunit levels. These interventions help maintain sarcolemmal integrity and may prevent age-related muscle mass and function decline (sarcopenia).",
    "impact_statement": "This study demonstrates that lifelong caloric restriction and exercise can preserve skeletal muscle sarcolemmal health during aging, offering potential strategies to combat sarcopenia and improve quality of life in older populations."
