    "summary_full": "This document is a correction to a previously published article in Genome Biology and Evolution. The correction addresses errors in the caption of Figure 7. The original caption incorrectly assigned colors to different protein families (CAHS, MAHS, SAHS, EtAHS alpha, EtAHS beta, and MRE11). The corrected caption provides the accurate color representation for each protein family.",
