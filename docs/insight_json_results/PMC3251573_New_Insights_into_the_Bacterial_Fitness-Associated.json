    "summary_full": "This study characterizes the plasmids pChi7122-2, pChi7122-3, and pChi7122-4 from the avian pathogenic E. coli (APEC) strain χ7122. The plasmids pChi7122-2 and pChi7122-3 encode an ABC iron transport system (eitABCD) and type IV fimbriae, respectively, while pChi7122-4 is cryptic. A novel sugar utilization pathway operon, found in Salmonella but not other E. coli strains, was identified on pChi7122-2. Experiments evaluating the role of these plasmids individually and in combination revealed their influence on biofilm formation, bile and acid tolerance, and interaction with intestinal epithelial cells. The study also investigated the effect of different host strain backgrounds on these plasmid-associated phenotypes, highlighting the complex interplay between plasmids, host genetics, and environmental conditions in shaping ExPEC fitness and diversity.",

The research demonstrates that these plasmids, individually or in combination, significantly influence bacterial fitness traits such as biofilm formation, bile, and acid tolerance, with effects modulated by the host strain background. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of fitness and diversity in ExPEC, highlighting the crucial role of extrachromosomal elements in bacterial adaptation and survival.",
