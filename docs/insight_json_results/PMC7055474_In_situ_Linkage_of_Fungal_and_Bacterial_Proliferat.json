    "summary_full": "This study investigated the link between microbial proliferation and microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) in operational B20 biodiesel storage tanks over a year. Researchers collected fuel and biofilm samples from two US Air Force bases, identifying microorganisms and measuring corrosion rates. Bacterial populations were diverse and location-specific, including Acetobacteraceae, Clostridiaceae, and Proteobacteria. However, abundant eukaryotic communities at both locations were dominated by a filamentous fungus (Trichocomaceae) and yeasts (Saccharomycetaceae). Increases in the fungal Trichocomaceae abundance correlated with significant fuel fouling and pitting corrosion, particularly at the bottom of the tanks. This is the first in situ study to integrate microbial community analysis with corrosion measurements in an active biodiesel storage environment, highlighting the role of specific fungi in fuel degradation and MIC.",
