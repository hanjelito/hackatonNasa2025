    "summary_full": "This study investigates the regulation of root surface pH in Arabidopsis thaliana, focusing on the distinct acidic and alkaline zones observed along the root tip. Using an improved method for pH visualization, researchers found that the alkaline pH domain in the transition zone is not primarily controlled by AHA H+-ATPases. Instead, it is established by a rapid auxin response module involving the AUX1 auxin influx carrier, AFB1 auxin co-receptor, and CNGC14 calcium channel. Mutants lacking these components showed altered pH profiles and impaired root navigation. The study proposes that this AUX1-AFB1-CNGC14 module constantly drives a rapid auxin response, enabling roots to efficiently navigate the soil by rapidly adjusting growth direction in response to stimuli like gravity.",

    "conclusions": "The study reveals that the longitudinal root surface pH profile, particularly the alkaline domain in the transition zone, is established by a rapid auxin response module comprising AUX1, AFB1, and CNGC14. This module operates continuously, enabling roots to efficiently navigate the soil by rapidly adjusting growth direction in response to stimuli like gravity. The findings highlight a novel mechanism for auxin-mediated root growth regulation beyond the canonical signaling pathways.",
