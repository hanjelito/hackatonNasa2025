    "summary_full": "This study investigated the physiological and transcriptomic changes in Mycobacterium marinum when exposed to low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) using high aspect ratio vessels. M. marinum grown under LSMMG transitioned from exponential phase earlier and showed reduced growth compared to normal gravity (NG) controls. Transcriptome analysis revealed significant alterations in gene expression, including downregulation of translation and metabolism, increased lipid degradation, and enhanced chaperone and mycobactin expression. The sigma factor H (sigH) was consistently upregulated under LSMMG. These changes suggest that LSMMG may simulate a nutrient-deprived environment, similar to conditions within a macrophage during infection. While LSMMG-grown bacteria were more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, their resistance to gamma radiation and acid remained unchanged. The findings implicate sigH in the LSMMG response and suggest potential implications for pathogenic mycobacteria in spacecraft environments.",

    "conclusions": "Exposure to low-shear modeled microgravity (LSMMG) induces significant physiological and transcriptomic changes in Mycobacterium marinum, leading to altered growth patterns, increased sensitivity to oxidative stress (H2O2), and a transcriptome suggestive of nutrient deprivation. The upregulation of the sigma factor H (sigH) appears central to this response, potentially priming the bacteria for survival in host environments like macrophages. These findings highlight the complex adaptations of pathogenic mycobacteria to microgravity and suggest potential implications for astronaut health and spacecraft contamination.",
