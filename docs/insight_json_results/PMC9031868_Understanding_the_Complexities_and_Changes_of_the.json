    "summary_full": "This review explores the critical role of the astronaut microbiome in human health during space missions. It details how spaceflight conditions like microgravity, radiation, and psychological stress can alter the composition and function of the microbiome, potentially leading to health issues such as immune dysregulation, bone loss, and altered cognitive function. The paper discusses the impact on gut, skin, and oral microbiomes, as well as the influence of space diets and the built environment. It highlights gender differences in microbiome response and the implications for drug efficacy (pharmacogenomics). Recommendations are provided for incorporating microbiome monitoring and personalized countermeasures into future long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars, emphasizing the need for a systems biology approach and further research into host-microbe interactions.",
