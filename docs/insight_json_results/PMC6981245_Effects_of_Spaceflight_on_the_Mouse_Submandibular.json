    "summary_full": "This study investigated the impact of spaceflight on the morphology and biochemistry of the mouse submandibular gland. Tissues from female mice flown on Space Shuttle missions (STS-131 and STS-135 for 15 and 13 days, respectively) and male mice flown on the Russian Bion-M1 biosatellite (30 days) were analyzed using electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. While no significant morphological changes were observed in the submandibular gland, protein expression differed between sexes and flight durations. Female mice showed no significant changes in protein expression after 13-15 days. However, male mice exposed to 30 days of spaceflight exhibited increased levels of salivary androgen binding protein alpha (SABPα) in acinar cells, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) in granular convoluted duct cells. These findings suggest that spaceflight alters secretory protein expression in the submandibular gland, with responses potentially influenced by the animal's sex and the duration of the flight. The study also highlights that different salivary glands respond uniquely to spaceflight and proposes that saliva analysis could be a valuable tool for monitoring astronaut health.",

    "conclusions": "Spaceflight, particularly for longer durations (30 days), alters the expression of specific secretory proteins in the mouse submandibular gland, with effects potentially influenced by the animal's sex. Unlike the parotid gland, no significant morphological changes were observed in the submandibular gland. These findings suggest that saliva analysis could be a valuable non-invasive method for monitoring astronaut physiology and health during long-term space missions.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals that spaceflight can alter protein production in salivary glands, suggesting saliva analysis as a potential tool for monitoring astronaut health in space."
