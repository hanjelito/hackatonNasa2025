    "summary_full": "This study characterized five Enterobacter bugandensis strains isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) for their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) properties, multi-drug resistance (MDR) gene profiles, and potential virulence factors. Whole genome sequencing was performed on these ISS strains and compared with three clinical E. bugandensis strains. Phylogenetic analyses, including MLST and whole-genome SNP analysis, confirmed the ISS isolates as E. bugandensis and showed their close genetic relatedness to clinical isolates. The ISS strains possess genes associated with virulence, disease, defense, and resistance to multiple antibiotics, including MDR tripartite systems and MAR operons. The PathogenFinder algorithm predicted a high probability (>79%) of pathogenicity for these ISS strains. The study concludes that these MDR E. bugandensis strains pose significant health considerations for future space missions, and further in vivo studies are needed to understand the influence of microgravity on their pathogenicity.",
