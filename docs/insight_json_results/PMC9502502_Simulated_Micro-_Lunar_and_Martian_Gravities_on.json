    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of simulated microgravity, lunar gravity, and Martian gravity on the growth, phenotype, and antibiotic sensitivity of three strains of Escherichia coli, including a uropathogenic strain and its rpoS knockout mutant. Using inclined clinostats and a custom-developed code to determine optimal rotation speeds, the researchers simulated these reduced gravity conditions on Earth. Results showed varied growth dynamics across strains and gravitational conditions, with some strains exhibiting increased growth under simulated micro- and lunar gravities. Notably, higher antibiotic concentrations were required to inhibit bacterial growth under simulated lunar gravity compared to simulated micro- and Martian gravities for certain strains. While acknowledging the limitations of clinostat simulations, the study provides a baseline for understanding microbial behavior in extraterrestrial environments and suggests potential implications for human health, such as increased UTI risk due to enhanced bacterial growth.",
