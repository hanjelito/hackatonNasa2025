    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of low-fluid-shear environments, mimicking conditions in the human host (e.g., the intestine), on Staphylococcus aureus. Using rotating-wall vessel bioreactors, S. aureus was cultured under low-shear conditions, resulting in the formation of an attachment-independent biofilm characterized by extensive extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). These low-shear cultured cells exhibited slower growth, reduced carotenoid production, increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, and decreased survival in whole blood compared to control cultures. Transcriptional profiling revealed significant alterations in metabolic pathways and, notably, a downregulation of the RNA chaperone Hfq. This repression of Hfq is significant as it is the first reported association of Hfq with fluid shear in a Gram-positive organism, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved response across diverse prokaryotes. The findings suggest that S. aureus adapts to low-fluid-shear environments by adopting a biofilm/colonization phenotype with diminished virulence, offering insights into the factors that differentiate infection from colonization.",
