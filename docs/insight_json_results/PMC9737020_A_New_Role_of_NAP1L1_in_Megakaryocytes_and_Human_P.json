    "summary_full": "This study investigates the function of Nuclear Assembly Protein 1 Like 1 (NAP1L1) in human platelets (PLTs) and megakaryocytes (MKs). Researchers found that NAP1L1 is expressed in both cell types and interacts with dihydrolipolylysine-residue acetyltransferase (DLAT), a component of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex. In PLTs from septic patients, NAP1L1 expression and PDH activity were increased, while PDC-E2 protein levels decreased. Conversely, overexpression of NAP1L1 in MKs led to reduced proplatelet formation and decreased PDH activity, particularly when challenged with LPS. These findings suggest NAP1L1 plays a role beyond nucleosome assembly, potentially acting as a chaperone or gatekeeper influencing mitochondrial function and thrombopoiesis, especially in the context of sepsis.",

    "conclusions": "NAP1L1 is expressed in human platelets and megakaryocytes, exhibiting alternative transcript variants and protein isoforms. It interacts with PDC-E2, a component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. In sepsis, NAP1L1 expression is altered, impacting PDH activity and potentially thrombopoiesis. NAP1L1's role extends beyond nucleosome assembly, influencing mitochondrial function and platelet production, particularly in inflammatory states.",
