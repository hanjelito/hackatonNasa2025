    "summary_full": "This study investigated Sphingomonas strains isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) and a cleanroom used for spacecraft assembly to identify plant growth-promoting features. Phylogenetic analysis identified ISS strains as Sphingomonas sanguinis and a cleanroom strain as Sphingomonas paucimobilis. Metagenomic analysis revealed the prevalence of Sphingomonas species on the ISS. Comparative genomic analysis with a known plant growth-promoting strain, Sphingomonas sp. LK11, identified genes associated with phytohormone production (specifically indole-3-acetic acid, IAA) and stress tolerance in the space-isolated strains. IAA production was experimentally confirmed in the ISS strains using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The study also found conserved pathways for phosphate uptake and metabolism, as well as genes conferring resistance to abiotic stresses like heat/cold shock, heavy metals, and oxidative/osmotic stress. Functional differences were observed between the spaceflight isolates and their terrestrial type strains, including genes related to horizontal gene transfer, antibiotic resistance, and the biosynthesis of industrially important metabolites. These findings suggest that these space-derived Sphingomonas strains have significant potential for promoting plant growth and enhancing stress tolerance, which could be crucial for developing self-sustainable life support systems in future long-duration space missions.",
