    "summary_full": "This review examines the current and potential roles of lab-on-a-chip (LoC) nanobiosensor technologies for space exploration and extreme environment investigations. As space missions increase, there's a growing need for analytical measurements with low payload requirements. LoC technology offers a solution due to its small footprint, high accuracy, and low power consumption. While some approaches exist for astronaut health monitoring, applications for microbiological and environmental variables in space and analogous Earth environments are less explored. The review highlights the advantages of LoC, including robustness, cost-effectiveness, real-time capabilities, and small form factor, making them ideal for space biology, life detection, and astronaut health monitoring. It discusses specific sensor applications for extreme temperatures, volcanic environments, environmental microbes, underwater conditions, and pH measurements, as well as for monitoring astronaut physiology and radiation exposure. The paper concludes that LoC-based sensors, potentially combined with AI and telemetry, are the most suitable detection systems for harsh environments and space exploration, with ongoing advancements in engineering and nanomaterials promising further improvements.",
