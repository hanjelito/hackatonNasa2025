    "summary_full": "This study investigates the mechanism behind the dysfunction of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) in conditions like Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), characterized by repeated cycles of damage and repair. Researchers found that early telomere shortening in diseased MuSCs from both mice and human DMD patients is linked to aberrant NF-κB activation. Prolonged NF-κB activation in MuSCs during chronic injuries leads to shortened telomeres, Ku80 dysregulation, and severe skeletal muscle defects. The study demonstrates that NF-κB regulates telomere length in MuSCs independently of cell replication, a mechanism potentially applicable to other tissues affected by chronic inflammation. The findings highlight a novel role for NF-κB in stem cell dysfunction via telomere shortening, contributing to the progression of DMD.",

    "conclusions": "Persistent NF-κB activation in muscle stem cells, driven by chronic injury or conditions like Duchenne muscular dystrophy, leads to telomere shortening through Ku80 dysregulation, independent of cell proliferation. This telomere dysfunction results in stem cell exhaustion and exacerbates skeletal muscle defects. The findings suggest that targeting NF-κB or Ku80 could be a therapeutic strategy for DMD and other diseases characterized by chronic inflammation and stem cell dysfunction.",
