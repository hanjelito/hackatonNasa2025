    "summary_full": "Mechanical unloading, such as during bedrest or spaceflight, leads to skeletal muscle atrophy and a shift from slow-twitch to fast-twitch fibers. A key early event is the translocation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOSμ) from the sarcolemma to the cytosol. This study investigated the role of redox signaling in this process using EUK-134, a superoxide dismutase and catalase mimetic, in a rat model of short-term (54-hour) hindlimb unloading (HU). Results showed that EUK-134 significantly mitigated muscle fiber atrophy and the fiber-type shift. It also prevented the translocation of nNOSμ from the sarcolemma to the cytosol and reduced the dephosphorylation of FoxO3a at Thr-32. Furthermore, EUK-134 normalized the increased oxidative stress (measured by 4-hydroxynonenal) and the sarcolemmal localization of Nox2 subunits (gp91phox and p47phox) observed in the HU group. These findings support the hypothesis that oxidative stress triggers nNOSμ translocation and FoxO3a dephosphorylation as early events in mechanical unloading, suggesting redox signaling acts as a switch for nNOS to initiate muscle fiber morphological changes.",

    "conclusions": "Short-term mechanical unloading induces oxidative stress, leading to the translocation of nNOSμ from the sarcolemma to the cytosol and dephosphorylation of FoxO3a, which contribute to muscle fiber atrophy and fiber-type shift. EUK-134, by mitigating oxidative stress, effectively prevents these events, highlighting the critical role of redox signaling in initiating the skeletal muscle unloading phenotype.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals that targeting oxidative stress with EUK-134 can prevent early muscle atrophy and fiber-type changes associated with disuse, offering potential therapeutic strategies for conditions like spaceflight-induced muscle loss and prolonged bed rest."
