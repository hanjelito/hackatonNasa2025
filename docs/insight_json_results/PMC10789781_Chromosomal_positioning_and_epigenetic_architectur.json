    "summary_full": "This study investigates the impact of galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on DNA methylation patterns, considering the influence of chromosomal positioning and epigenetic architecture. Using in vitro irradiation of human lung epithelial cells with high-LET (56Fe, 28Si) and low-LET (X-ray) radiation, the researchers found that 56Fe induces a persistent increase in DNA methylation, while 28Si and X-ray cause a transient decrease. The study also revealed that the spatial organization of chromatin within the nucleus and the presence of specific histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K27ac) are associated with increased DNA methylation changes, particularly in promoter and enhancer regions. These in vitro findings were validated using gene expression data from irradiated mice and astronauts, confirming the persistent epigenetic and transcriptomic response to GCR, especially from 56Fe exposure.",

    "conclusions": "Galactic cosmic radiation induces distinct acute and chronic DNA methylation and gene expression patterns, influenced by chromosomal positioning and epigenetic architecture. Specifically, 56Fe radiation leads to persistent DNA methylation increases, while 28Si and X-rays cause transient decreases. Regulatory regions marked by active histone modifications are more susceptible to these changes. These findings highlight the vulnerability of specific genomic regions to GCR and suggest that chromatin architecture, particularly heterochromatin, plays a crucial role in cellular response to radiation.",
