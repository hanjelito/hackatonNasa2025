    "summary_full": "This study investigates the effectiveness of RNAlater, a chemical preservative, for preserving Arabidopsis thaliana tissues for RNA sequencing and LC-MS/MS protein analysis. While RNAlater successfully preserves plant material, it induces significant transcriptomic and proteomic responses. Specifically, 5770 gene transcripts, 84 soluble proteins, and 120 membrane-bound proteins showed differential expression. Post-translational modifications were also affected, with 21.3% of phosphorylated proteins showing altered abundance. The findings suggest that RNAlater, while convenient, can alter molecular profiles, warranting caution in its use for omics experiments.",

    "conclusions": "RNAlater is effective for preserving RNA and protein integrity in Arabidopsis thaliana tissues for omics analyses. However, the preservative induces significant transcriptomic and proteomic responses, including altered gene expression related to osmotic stress and changes in protein abundance and post-translational modifications. Researchers should exercise caution when using RNAlater for plant omics experiments, as these induced changes could potentially mask or mimic true biological responses.",
    "impact_statement": "This study highlights the potential for chemical fixatives like RNAlater to introduce artifacts in transcriptomic and proteomic data from plant tissues, necessitating careful consideration of preservation methods in biological research."
