    "summary_full": "This study investigates the role of leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived cells in mediating obesity-associated adipose tissue (AT) inflammation and insulin resistance. Researchers generated radiation chimeric mice reconstituted with either leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) or wild-type (WT) bone marrow and fed them a high-fat diet (HFD) for 16 weeks. Mice with db/db bone marrow (WT/db) showed significantly lower body weight, adiposity, and AT inflammation, characterized by reduced expression of inflammatory genes (Tnfa, Il6, Ccl2) and fewer crown-like structures. Their AT macrophages exhibited an anti-inflammatory phenotype (MGL1+, CCR2-). WT/db mice also displayed improved insulin sensitivity compared to WT/WT mice. These findings suggest that leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived cells is crucial for inducing AT inflammation and contributes to obesity-related metabolic complications, supporting leptin's role as a proinflammatory cytokine.",

    "conclusions": "Leptin signaling in bone marrow-derived cells plays a critical role in the development of adipose tissue inflammation associated with obesity and contributes to insulin resistance.
