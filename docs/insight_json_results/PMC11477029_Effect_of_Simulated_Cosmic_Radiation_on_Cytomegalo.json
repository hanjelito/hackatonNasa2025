    "summary_full": "This study investigated the impact of simulated galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) on the reactivation of latent cytomegalovirus (CMV) in Kasumi-3 cells. Latently infected cells were exposed to various types of radiation, including gamma rays, protons, carbon ions, iron ions, and simulated GCR. Results showed a significant increase in CMV copy number in irradiated cells compared to controls, indicating reactivation and lytic replication. While viral genome sequencing revealed no significant nucleotide differences, transcriptome analysis identified the upregulation of the UL49 open reading frame (ORF), suggesting its role in the switch from latency to lytic replication. These findings support the hypothesis that GCR is a significant factor in CMV reactivation observed in astronauts on the International Space Station.",

    "conclusions": "Space radiation directly contributes to the reactivation of latent cytomegalovirus (CMV), as evidenced by increased viral load and the upregulation of the UL49 gene. This finding suggests that radiation, independent of immune dysregulation, is a significant factor in CMV reactivation observed in astronauts, highlighting potential health risks for long-duration space missions.",
    "impact_statement": "This study demonstrates that simulated cosmic radiation can directly reactivate latent cytomegalovirus, providing crucial insights into potential health risks for astronauts and informing the development of countermeasures for space exploration."
