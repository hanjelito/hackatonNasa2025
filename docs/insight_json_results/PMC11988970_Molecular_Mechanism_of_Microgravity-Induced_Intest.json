    "summary_full": "This study investigates the effects of simulated microgravity (SMG) on mice using a 3D-Clinostat to understand its impact on gut microbiota, liver, and brain metabolism. SMG induced osteoporosis, damaged colonic tissue, and altered gut microbiota diversity and composition. Predicted gut microbiota functions indicated disruptions in lipid and amino acid metabolism, and the digestive, nervous, and endocrine systems. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from SMG mice to WT mice replicated these gut microbiota changes, suggesting a causal role for gut dysbiosis. Serum metabolomics revealed significant imbalances in lipid and amino acid metabolism in both SMG and FMT groups compared to WT. These metabolic disruptions were linked to hepatic steatosis, inflammation, reduced antioxidant capacity in the liver and brain, impaired spatial and working memory, and altered neurotransmitter levels. Valeric acid was identified as a potential key metabolite linking microgravity-induced gut dysbiosis to liver and brain metabolic disorders. The findings suggest that microgravity induces liver and brain abnormalities primarily through gut microbiota imbalance, with potential contributions from impaired intestinal barrier function, inflammation, and psychological factors.",

    "conclusions": "Microgravity, simulated using a 3D-Clinostat, induces significant gut microbiota dysbiosis in mice, which in turn leads to metabolic imbalances in the liver and brain. These imbalances manifest as hepatic steatosis, impaired cognitive function, and altered neurotransmitter levels. Valeric acid is proposed as a key metabolite mediating these effects. The study highlights the critical role of the gut-brain-liver axis in adapting to microgravity and suggests potential targets for mitigating spaceflight-induced health issues.",
