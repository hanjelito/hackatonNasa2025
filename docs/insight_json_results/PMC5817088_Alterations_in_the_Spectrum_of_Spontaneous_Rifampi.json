    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of the human spaceflight environment on Bacillus subtilis, specifically focusing on growth, mutation frequency, and the spectrum of mutations leading to rifampicin resistance (RifR). Experiments were conducted on two International Space Station (ISS) missions (BRIC-18 and BRIC-21) with matching ground controls. While no significant differences in growth or RifR mutation frequency were observed between flight (FL) and ground control (GC) samples, nucleotide sequencing of the rpoB gene revealed distinct differences in the mutation spectrum. Notably, two new rpoB alleles (Q137R and L489S) were identified exclusively in FL samples. These findings suggest that the spaceflight environment imposes unique stresses on bacteria, leading to altered mutagenic potential and a different landscape of genetic changes.",

    "conclusions": "The study demonstrates that while spaceflight does not significantly alter bacterial growth or the overall frequency of rifampicin resistance mutations, it does induce a distinct spectrum of mutations in the rpoB gene. The identification of novel mutations exclusively in flight samples suggests that the unique stresses of the spaceflight environment can specifically influence the types of genetic changes that occur in bacteria, supporting the concept of stress-induced mutagenesis.",
    "impact_statement": "This research reveals that the spaceflight environment can alter bacterial mutation patterns, which has implications for understanding microbial adaptation, the emergence of antibiotic resistance, and potential risks to astronaut health during long-duration space missions."
