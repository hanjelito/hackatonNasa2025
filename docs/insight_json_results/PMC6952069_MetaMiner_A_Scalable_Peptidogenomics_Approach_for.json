    "document_title": "MetaMiner: A Scalable Peptidogenomics Approach for Discovery of Ribosomal Peptide Natural Products with Blind Modifications from Microbial Communities",
    "summary_full": "This paper introduces MetaMiner, a novel software tool designed to overcome limitations in discovering Ribosomally synthesized and Post-translationally modified Peptides (RiPPs) from large-scale genomic and metagenomic datasets. Existing methods struggle with unknown post-translational modifications and are not scalable. MetaMiner integrates genome mining with computational mass spectrometry, enabling the search of millions of spectra against numerous genomic datasets. The tool successfully identified 31 known and 7 unknown RiPPs from diverse microbial communities, including the human microbiome, lichen microbiome, and microorganisms from the International Space Station. This approach significantly advances the discovery of natural products with potential pharmaceutical applications.",
