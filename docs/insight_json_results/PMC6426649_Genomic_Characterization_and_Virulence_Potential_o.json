    "summary_full": "This study details the genomic characterization of two Fusarium oxysporum isolates, ISS-F3 and ISS-F4, cultured from the International Space Station (ISS). These isolates were found to be genomically distinct from 65 known strains. While their effector gene profiles suggest they are unlikely to be plant pathogens, virulence assays using an immunocompromised Caenorhabditis elegans model demonstrated that both ISS-F3 and ISS-F4 are virulent and may act as opportunistic pathogens in animals, including humans. The analysis also revealed a higher relative abundance of polyketide synthase domains in these ISS strains compared to a non-plant-pathogenic soil isolate and a clinical isolate, suggesting potential for producing novel secondary metabolites. The findings have implications for crew health on the ISS, as well as for the medical, agricultural, and food industries.",

    "conclusions": "The study characterized two novel Fusarium oxysporum strains isolated from the ISS, demonstrating their genomic distinctiveness and potential as opportunistic pathogens in animal models, despite lacking typical plant pathogenicity factors. Their unique genomic features, including enhanced polyketide synthase domains, suggest potential for novel secondary metabolite production. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring microbial life in space environments for crew health and potential biotechnological applications.",
