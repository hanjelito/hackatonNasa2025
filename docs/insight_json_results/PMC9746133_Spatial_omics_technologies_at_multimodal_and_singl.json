    "document_title": "Spatial omics technologies at multimodal and single cell/subcellular level",
    "summary_full": "This review provides a comprehensive overview of current and prospective spatial omics technologies, focusing on those capable of single-cell and subcellular resolution. These technologies enable a deeper understanding of cellular organization and interactions within tissues by profiling transcript or protein abundance in situ. The review categorizes methods into targeted (probe- or antibody-based) and transcriptome-wide (NGS-based) approaches, detailing their spatial resolution, multiplexing capabilities, scale, and coverage. It discusses various platforms, including those using sequential imaging, mass spectrometry, and in situ sequencing, highlighting their technical specifications and applications. The paper also covers computational methodologies for analyzing spatial omics data, such as cell segmentation, dimensionality reduction, and spatial pattern identification, as well as strategies for integrating multi-modal data. Finally, it touches upon experimental design considerations and available reference databases, emphasizing the transformative potential of spatial omics for research and clinical applications.",
