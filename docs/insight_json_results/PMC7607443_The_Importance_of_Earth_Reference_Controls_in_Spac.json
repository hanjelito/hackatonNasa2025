    "summary_full": "This study investigates the role of Arabidopsis thaliana nucleolin genes (NUC1 and NUC2) in plant adaptive responses to stress, using ground-based experiments as controls for future spaceflight omics research. The research aims to understand how plants adapt to space environments for enabling space farming. By analyzing nucleolin mutants under different light conditions (darkness vs. red light), the study reveals that NUC2 can compensate for darkness-induced stress in nuc1 mutants, while nuc2 mutants show an incomplete response to red light. These findings highlight the importance of ground controls for interpreting spaceflight omics data and identifying genetic backgrounds that confer adaptive advantages for plants in space. The study also details the differential transcriptional responses of wild-type and nucleolin mutant plants to red light and darkness, providing a baseline for understanding spaceflight-induced alterations.",
