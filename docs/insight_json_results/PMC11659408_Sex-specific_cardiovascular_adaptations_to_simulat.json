    "document_title": "Sex-specific cardiovascular adaptations to simulated microgravity in Sprague-Dawley rats",
    "summary_full": "This study investigated sex-specific cardiovascular responses to simulated microgravity (hindlimb unloading, HLU) in Sprague-Dawley rats. After 14 days of HLU, female rats exhibited increased aortic arch pulse wave velocity (PWV), indicating greater arterial stiffness, and diastolic dysfunction, while male rats showed no significant changes in PWV. Mechanistically, HLU females had lower levels of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) and PPARγ, along with increased oxidative stress markers, compared to control females. Treatment with a GPER agonist (G1) in HLU females reversed the increase in PWV and reduced oxidative stress, suggesting that reduced GPER contributes to arterial stiffening in simulated microgravity. The study highlights significant sex differences in cardiovascular adaptation to microgravity, with females showing increased susceptibility to arterial stiffening.",

    "conclusions": "This study demonstrates significant sex-specific adaptations of the cardiovascular system to simulated microgravity, with female rats exhibiting increased arterial stiffness and diastolic dysfunction. Reduced GPER levels in females appear to contribute to these changes, as GPER activation mitigated arterial stiffening. The Sprague-Dawley rat model is suitable for studying sex-specific mechanisms of vascular adaptation to microgravity, highlighting the need for sex-specific countermeasures for astronauts.",
    "impact_statement": "This research reveals critical sex differences in cardiovascular responses to simulated microgravity, identifying GPER as a potential therapeutic target to mitigate arterial stiffening, which is crucial for the health of astronauts during long-duration space missions."
