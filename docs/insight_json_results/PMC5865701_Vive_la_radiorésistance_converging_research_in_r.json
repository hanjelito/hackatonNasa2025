    "document_title": "Vive la radior√©sistance!: converging research in radiobiology and biogerontology to enhance human radioresistance for deep space exploration and colonization",
    "summary_full": "This paper proposes a roadmap for enhancing human radioresistance to mitigate the health risks associated with deep space exploration and colonization. It outlines several research directions, including upregulating endogenous repair and radioprotective mechanisms, exploring gene therapy for enhanced radioresistance through exogenous and engineered DNA repair mechanisms, substituting organic molecules with fortified isoforms, and developing methods to slow metabolic activity while preserving cognitive function. The authors highlight the association between radioresistance and longevity, suggesting that enhancing radioresistance could also extend the healthspan of spacefarers. The paper details the threats posed by cosmic radiation, its molecular and cellular effects, and various proposed countermeasures, ranging from medical selection and small molecule interventions to hypostasis, gene therapy, and the utilization of AI for diagnosis and treatment.",
