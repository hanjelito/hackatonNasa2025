    "summary_full": "This study introduces and validates a simplified imaging technique, Single-Image Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (SI-NDVI), for early detection of plant stress in controlled environments. The SI-NDVI method utilizes a modified camera with a dual bandpass filter to capture both visible (blue) and near-infrared (NIR) light reflectance in a single image, allowing for cost-effective and user-friendly analysis compared to traditional NDVI or hyperspectral imaging. The system was tested on Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings subjected to salinity stress and Eruca sativa plants under ammonium nitrate treatment. Results demonstrated that SI-NDVI could detect stress within 15 minutes of salinity application and within 6 hours of ammonium nitrate exposure, significantly before visual symptoms appeared. The analysis involves processing images with open-source software like Fiji to generate qualitative false-color images and quantitative graphs tracking changes in SI-NDVI values over time. This technique holds promise for applications in indoor farming, high-throughput screening, and space biology by enabling rapid and early identification of plant stress.",
