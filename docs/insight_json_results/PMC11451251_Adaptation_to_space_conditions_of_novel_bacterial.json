    "summary_full": "This study investigates the genomic adaptations of five novel bacterial species isolated from the International Space Station (ISS). Using advanced deep-learning tools for functional gene annotation, researchers achieved near-complete annotation of protein-coding genes. Comparative genomic and proteomic analyses revealed common traits across these ISS bacteria, as well as unique genetic features suggesting adaptation to the space environment. These adaptations include mechanisms for managing hypoosmotic stress (via mechanosensitive channel proteins), enhanced DNA repair to counter radiation, and the presence of mobile genetic elements for metabolic flexibility. The study also identified genetic traits indicative of potential pathogenicity, such as small molecule and peptide synthesis, and ATP-dependent transporters, which may explain previously observed increases in antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity in space-exposed microbes. The findings suggest convergent evolution among these diverse microorganisms, with potential applications in bioproduction for future space missions or as targets for drug development if health risks are identified.",

    "conclusions": "The study demonstrates that novel bacterial species isolated from the ISS have adapted to the space environment through specific genetic and proteomic changes. These adaptations, including enhanced DNA repair, stress response mechanisms, and novel metabolic capabilities, suggest a convergent evolutionary path. The identified genetic traits have implications for both the potential risks (pathogenicity) and benefits (bioproduction) of these microorganisms in future space exploration.",
