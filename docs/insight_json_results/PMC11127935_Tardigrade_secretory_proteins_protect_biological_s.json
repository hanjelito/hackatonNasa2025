    "summary_full": "This study investigates tardigrade secretory-abundant heat soluble (SAHS) proteins and their ability to protect biological structures from desiccation. Recombinantly expressed SAHS proteins were found to prevent liposome fusion and enhance the desiccation tolerance of E. coli and Rhizobium tropici when applied extracellularly. Molecular dynamics simulations and structural analysis suggest that SAHS proteins undergo a structural transition upon desiccation, potentially by destabilizing their beta-sheet structure due to water removal from an internal cavity. These findings highlight the potential application of SAHS proteins as stabilizing molecules for cell preservation.",

    "conclusions": "Tardigrade SAHS proteins are effective extracellular protectants against desiccation-induced damage to liposomes and bacterial cells. They appear to function by undergoing a structural transition upon dehydration, potentially forming stabilizing structures. While not protecting enzymes, their ability to preserve microbial cells suggests significant potential for applications in biotechnology and biofertilizer preservation.",
