    "summary_full": "This study investigates how mechanostimulation, applied through clinorotation, affects gravitropism and the persistence of the gravity signal in flax roots. Roots were reoriented horizontally and then clinorotated either vertically or horizontally at various speeds. Vertical clinorotation reduced root growth by approximately 7%, while horizontal clinorotation did not significantly affect growth rate. The speed of clinorotation did not impact growth, but it influenced curvature: vertical clinorotation decreased curvature with increasing speed, leading to straight roots at 5 rpm, whereas horizontal clinorotation increased curvature with speed. The persistence of the gravity signal, measured by the time to maximal curvature, was found to be about 120 minutes. The findings suggest that mechanostimulation modifies the magnitude of the graviresponse but does not alter the memory persistence of the gravity signal.",

    "conclusions": "The study concludes that both the angular velocity and direction of clinorotation significantly interfere with the graviresponse mechanism in flax roots. While the gravity signal persists for approximately 2 hours and 10 minutes of reorientation is sufficient to saturate the gravitropic signal, mechanostimulation influences the magnitude of the response without affecting signal memory. Differences observed between vertical and horizontal clinorotation provide an avenue for identifying specific cellular components or processes involved in differential elongation.",
    "impact_statement": "This research clarifies how mechanical forces influence plant gravitropism, providing insights into signal perception, processing, and memory in roots, which is crucial for understanding plant growth in altered gravity environments."
