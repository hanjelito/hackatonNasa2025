    "summary_full": "This study investigates the role of the mannose receptor (Mrc1) in bone marrow (BM) cell reprogramming and metabolic profiles during diet-induced obesity. Researchers fed Mrc1-deficient (Mrc1−/−) mice and wild-type (WT) littermates a high-fat diet (HFD) for 20 weeks. Mrc1−/− mice exhibited impaired medullary hematopoiesis with reduced myeloid progenitors and mature cells, alongside an increase in BM adipocytes. Consequently, circulating neutrophils and pro-inflammatory monocytes decreased in Mrc1−/− mice. These mice also showed reduced macrophage infiltration in visceral adipose tissue and the liver, decreased liver steatosis, and improved glucose and insulin tolerance, with reduced weight gain compared to WT controls. The findings suggest that Mrc1 deficiency impacts BM and circulating immune cell subsets, leading to reduced systemic inflammation and resistance to obesity development.",

    "conclusions": "The mannose receptor (Mrc1) plays a significant role in modulating bone marrow hematopoiesis and immune cell profiles during high-fat diet-induced obesity. Mrc1 deficiency leads to a rewiring of the bone marrow environment, characterized by reduced myelopoiesis and increased adiposity, which in turn dampens systemic inflammation and confers resistance to obesity and its associated metabolic dysfunctions.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals that targeting the mannose receptor could be a therapeutic strategy to mitigate obesity and its related inflammatory complications by modulating bone marrow immune cell populations and reducing systemic inflammation."
