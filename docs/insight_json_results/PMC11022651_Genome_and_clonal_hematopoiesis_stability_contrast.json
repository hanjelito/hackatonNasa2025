    "summary_full": "This study investigated the physiological effects of short-duration spaceflight on civilians using a multi-omic approach during the Inspiration4 mission. Researchers analyzed DNA from dried blood spots collected pre-, during, and post-flight. They found that telomere length increased during spaceflight and shortened upon return to Earth, mirroring findings from longer missions. Cell-free DNA analysis indicated increased signatures of immune cells post-flight, suggesting cellular adaptations. Notably, no significant changes in clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) or whole-genome instability were observed. Gene expression analysis across immune cells revealed long-term adaptations to the space environment that persisted for months after the mission. The study provides valuable insights into the physiological consequences of short-duration spaceflight, with implications for future space exploration.",

    "conclusions": "Short-duration spaceflight induces significant changes in telomere length dynamics and immune cell gene expression, with some adaptations persisting long after return to Earth. While genomic stability and CHIP remained largely unaffected, the observed immune and telomere changes highlight the complex physiological responses to spaceflight, even for brief missions. These findings provide a crucial reference for future spaceflight endeavors, particularly for civilian astronauts.",
