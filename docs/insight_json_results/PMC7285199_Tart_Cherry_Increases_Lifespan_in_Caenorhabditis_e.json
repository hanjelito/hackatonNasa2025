    "summary_full": "This study investigates the effects of tart cherry extract (TCE) on aging and lifespan in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. The researchers found that daily supplementation with TCE at concentrations of 6 μg/mL and 12 μg/mL significantly increased the mean lifespan of wild-type worms. This lifespan extension was associated with the upregulation of longevity-related genes such as daf-16 and aak-2, and oxidative stress-related genes like sod-2. Furthermore, TCE supplementation enhanced spare mitochondrial respiration. Importantly, TCE did not extend the lifespan of daf-16 and aak-2 mutant worms, indicating that these pathways are crucial for TCE's beneficial effects. The study concludes that TCE confers healthspan benefits by improving mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative stress, primarily through the DAF-16 pathway.",

    "conclusions": "Tart cherry extract (TCE) significantly extends the lifespan of C. elegans in a DAF-16-dependent manner. This effect is attributed to the genetic regulation of the insulin/insulin-like signaling (IIS) and DAF-16 pathway, partial involvement of AAK-2 signaling, increased antioxidant activity, and enhanced spare respiratory capacity, which collectively improve cellular function under stress. These findings suggest a significant potential for TCE in promoting healthy aging in humans due to the conserved nature of these pathways.",
