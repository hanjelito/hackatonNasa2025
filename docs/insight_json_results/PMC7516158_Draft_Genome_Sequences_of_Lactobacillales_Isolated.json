    "document_title": "Draft Genome Sequences of Lactobacillales Isolated from the International Space Station",
    "summary_full": "This study reports the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of nineteen strains from the order Lactobacillales, isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) and a commercial resupply vehicle. The isolated bacteria include Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Aerococcus urinaeequi, some of which are known to possess pathogenicity characteristics like antibiotic resistance. The WGS data were generated using Illumina Nextera Flex protocol and NovaSeq 6000 platform, with subsequent quality control, assembly, and annotation. The aim is to characterize these bacteria adapting to the extreme space environment, which could inform the development of countermeasures against potential health risks for astronauts. The genome sequences have been deposited in public databases.",
