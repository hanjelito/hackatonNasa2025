    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of multiple cycles of hindlimb unloading (HLU) and reambulation (RA) on body composition and bone mineral density in adult male mice. Mice were subjected to one, two, or three cycles of 2-week HLU followed by 4-week RA. Results showed that while initial unloading caused significant decreases in total adipose tissue and lumbar bone mineral density (vBMD), the magnitude of these losses diminished with subsequent unloading cycles. Importantly, both adipose tissue and lumbar vBMD fully recovered after the final reambulation period, regardless of the number of HLU/RA cycles. However, upper hindlimb muscle cross-sectional area remained significantly lower than controls even after reambulation. The findings suggest that abdominal tissues are more resilient to repeated unloading and reambulation than peripheral musculoskeletal tissues, and previous unloading history attenuates the response to subsequent unloading.",

    "conclusions": "Multiple cycles of hindlimb unloading and reambulation do not cause persistent detrimental effects on abdominal adipose tissue and lumbar bone mineral density in mice. These tissues demonstrate resilience and full recovery post-reambulation. However, peripheral muscle tissues show a reduced capacity for recovery. The attenuated response to subsequent unloading cycles suggests that prior unloading experience influences tissue sensitivity.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals that repeated periods of unloading and recovery, similar to those experienced in spaceflight, do not permanently damage abdominal fat and bone in mice, but do impair muscle recovery, offering insights for developing targeted countermeasures for astronauts."
