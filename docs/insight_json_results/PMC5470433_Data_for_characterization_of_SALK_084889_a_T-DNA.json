    "summary_full": "This article characterizes the T-DNA insertion line SALK_084889 in Arabidopsis thaliana. T-DNA insertions were identified in the 3′ UTR of DREB2A and the promoter of LOX1. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was used to analyze the expression levels of DREB2A and LOX1 in SALK_084889 compared to wild-type (Col) plants. Drought and heat tolerance were also assessed. The data indicate that DREB2A expression is affected in roots under drought, while LOX1 is significantly downregulated in both roots and shoots under all tested conditions. These findings provide valuable data for understanding the roles of DREB2A and LOX1 in plant stress responses.",
