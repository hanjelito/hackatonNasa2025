    "summary_full": "This study investigated the role of two genes, SPIRAL1 (SPR1) and SKU5, involved in root skewing in Arabidopsis thaliana, in the plant's physiological adaptation to spaceflight. Using the APEX-03-2 spaceflight experiment, researchers compared the root behavior and gene expression patterns of spr1 and sku5 mutants with their respective wild-type controls under spaceflight and ground conditions. The spr1 mutant exhibited fewer differentially expressed genes compared to its wild-type, suggesting that the loss of SPR1 positively impacts spaceflight adaptation. Conversely, the sku5 mutant showed a significantly higher number of differentially expressed genes, indicating a more complex and stress-related response to spaceflight, and suggesting that proper SKU5 function is crucial for adaptation. Developmental age also played a significant role, particularly in sku5 plants. The study concludes that SPR1 and SKU5 pathways have unique and opposing contributions to spaceflight adaptation, with SPR1's absence enhancing adaptation and SKU5's proper function being essential.",

    "conclusions": "The study demonstrates that the skewing-associated genes SPR1 and SKU5 play distinct and opposing roles in the physiological adaptation of Arabidopsis thaliana to spaceflight. The spr1 mutation appears to enhance adaptation by reducing the transcriptomic response, while the sku5 mutation triggers a more complex stress response, highlighting SKU5's critical role in adaptation. These findings suggest that pathways regulating root directionality and morphology are integral to plant acclimation in space, likely involving cell wall remodeling and stress signaling.",
