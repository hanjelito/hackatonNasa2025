    "document_title": "Bread Wheat in Space Flight: Is There a Difference in Kernel Quality?",
    "summary_full": "This study investigated the impact of spaceflight conditions on the quality of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) kernels. Wheat kernels grown on the International Space Station (ISS) were compared to those grown in a similar terrestrial growth chamber. While most kernel parameters like weight, area, length, and width showed minor differences, the hypothesis of increased fluctuating asymmetry in space was not confirmed. However, significant differences were observed in starch granule composition, with ISS kernels having longer type A starch granules and a lower ratio of type B to type A granules, potentially affecting baking quality. Additionally, the width of aleurone layer cells was significantly smaller in ISS-grown kernels, suggesting a reduced protein component. The study also proposed a new non-traumatic method for assessing kernel asymmetry. The findings suggest that while basic kernel morphology is largely preserved, subtle changes in starch and protein content occur, possibly due to microgravity-induced stress. Modifications to growth chambers for better aeration are recommended to mitigate these effects and improve future space agriculture.",

    "conclusions": "While most physical parameters of wheat kernels grown in space were similar to those grown on Earth, there were notable differences in starch granule length and the ratio of starch types, as well as a reduction in aleurone cell width, suggesting potential impacts on baking quality and protein content. These changes may be attributed to stress factors in microgravity, such as altered water dynamics or hypoxia, highlighting the need for optimized growth chamber designs. The study also introduced a novel method for assessing kernel asymmetry, contributing to the development of space agriculture and self-sustaining ecosystems.",
