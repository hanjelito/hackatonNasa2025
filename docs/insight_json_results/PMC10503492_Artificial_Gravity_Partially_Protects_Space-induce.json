    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of microgravity (SFμg) and artificial gravity (SF1g) on the central nervous system (CNS) of Drosophila melanogaster aboard the International Space Station (ISS). While flies in microgravity showed increased activity inflight, they exhibited significant climbing defects postflight. Multi-omics analysis revealed alterations in metabolic, oxidative stress, and synaptic transmission pathways in both SFμg and SF1g conditions. However, immediate postflight neurological changes, including neuronal loss, glial cell alterations, oxidative damage, and apoptosis, were observed only in the SFμg group. Furthermore, progressive neuronal loss and glial phenotypes were noted in both SF1g and SFμg flies upon acclimation to Earth conditions, with more pronounced effects in the SFμg group. The findings suggest that artificial gravity offers partial protection against spaceflight-induced neurological deficits.",

    "conclusions": "Artificial gravity partially protects the Drosophila melanogaster central nervous system from spaceflight-induced neurological deficits, including neuronal loss, oxidative damage, and apoptosis. While microgravity exacerbates these effects, artificial gravity mitigates some immediate postflight damage. Both conditions induce molecular changes in metabolic and synaptic pathways, but the long-term effects and the precise mechanisms of protection require further investigation.",
    "impact_statement": "This study demonstrates that artificial gravity can partially protect the nervous system from the detrimental effects of spaceflight, offering crucial insights for safeguarding astronaut health during long-duration missions."
