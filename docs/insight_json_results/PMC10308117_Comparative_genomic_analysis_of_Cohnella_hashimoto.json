    "summary_full": "A novel bacterial species, Cohnella hashimotonis, was identified from a sample collected from the International Space Station (ISS). This gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium, designated F6_2S_P_1T, was isolated from the wall behind the Waste Hygiene Compartment. Phylogenetic and genomic analyses, including 16S rRNA, gyrB, Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI), and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH), placed it as a distinct species within the Cohnella genus, most closely related to C. rhizosphaerae and C. ginsengisoli, which are typically found in plant environments. Whole-genome sequencing of F6_2S_P_1T, C. rhizosphaerae, and C. ginsengisoli revealed a shared set of 332 gene clusters unique to this clade. Functional predictions suggest metabolic capabilities related to carbohydrate and amino acid transport, transcription, and cell wall biogenesis. The study also characterized the phenotypic and chemotaxonomic features of C. hashimotonis, noting its ability to metabolize a wide range of carbon compounds and its specific fatty acid profile. The presence of C. hashimotonis on the ISS is hypothesized to be from plant growth experiments rather than human commensalism. The genome analysis did not reveal genes for antimicrobial resistance or virulence.",
