    "summary_full": "This study investigated the cellular mechanisms behind the detrimental effects of high-dose whole-body gamma irradiation on bone in mice, and assessed radioadaptation and bone marrow transplantation as potential interventions. High-dose irradiation (6 Gy) led to significant bone architectural changes, including reduced bone volume and connectivity, and increased trabecular separation. Cellular analysis revealed a rapid decrease in bone marrow cell density, accompanied by a substantial, transient increase in osteoblast-lined bone perimeter and a rise in osteoclast-lined bone perimeter. This suggests that radiation-induced marrow cell death triggers the activation of bone lining cells to express an osteoblast phenotype and increases bone resorption. A low priming dose of radiation (0.5 mGy) did not mitigate these effects. However, bone marrow transplantation following lethal irradiation (9 Gy) effectively normalized marrow cell density, bone turnover, and most bone architecture indices, indicating its efficacy in mitigating radiation-induced skeletal damage.",

    "conclusions": "Acute high-dose whole-body gamma irradiation induces a significant bone turnover response characterized by increased bone formation (primarily via activation of bone lining cells) and bone resorption, temporally linked to bone marrow failure. Bone marrow transplantation is effective in restoring normal bone marrow function and mitigating the detrimental skeletal effects of lethal irradiation.",
    "impact_statement": "This study elucidates the cellular mechanisms of radiation-induced bone damage and demonstrates the therapeutic potential of bone marrow transplantation for mitigating these effects, which is crucial for patients undergoing radiation therapy and for future space exploration."
