    "summary_full": "This study reports the draft genome sequences of 94 fungal strains isolated from surfaces on the International Space Station (ISS) as part of the Microbial Tracking-2 study. The fungi represent 10 ascomycetous and 1 basidiomycetous species, including common environmental and opportunistic pathogens like Aspergillus, Aureobasidium, Cladosporium, Fusarium, Penicillium, and Rhodotorula. The genome characterization aims to assess fungal adaptation to microgravity, evaluate risks to human health and spacecraft integrity, and explore potential biotechnological applications. The methodology involved sample collection from ISS surfaces, DNA extraction, whole-genome shotgun sequencing, and subsequent quality filtering, assembly, and quality assessment. The data is publicly available in GenBank and the NASA GeneLab system.",
