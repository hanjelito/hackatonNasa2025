    "summary_full": "This study describes the isolation and characterization of six bacterial strains from the International Space Station (ISS), which were identified as five novel species: Arthrobacter burdickii, Leifsonia virtsii, Leifsonia williamsii, Paenibacillus vandeheii, and Sporosarcina highlanderae. These novel species were identified using a combination of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, whole genome sequencing (WGS), average nucleotide identity (ANI), digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH), and phenotypic analyses. The gyrB gene proved to be a more effective marker than 16S rRNA for distinguishing these novel species. Metagenomic analysis revealed that these novel species are rare in the ISS environment, constituting less than 0.1% of total reads. Genome annotation identified genes related to amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism, cofactors, vitamins, pigments, and protein metabolism. Notably, these bacteria possess genes associated with virulence, disease, and defense, including antibiotic and toxic compound resistance, and invasion capabilities. Secondary metabolite analysis revealed the presence of various biosynthetic gene clusters, including β-lactone and type III polyketide synthase (T3PKS) clusters, suggesting potential for novel bioactive compound production. The study highlights the importance of comprehensive genomic and phenotypic characterization for understanding the microbial diversity in space habitats, which is crucial for crew health and mission safety.",
