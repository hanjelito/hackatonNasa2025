    "summary_full": "This study investigates the impact of modeled microgravity (LSMMG) on the beneficial symbiont Vibrio fischeri, focusing on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and outer membrane vesicle (OMV) production. Using high-aspect ratio vessels (HARVs) to simulate microgravity, researchers found that LSMMG conditions significantly increased the release of LPS by V. fischeri compared to gravity controls. This increased LPS shedding was correlated with enhanced OMV production, a process previously linked to flagellar motility. While motility-deficient mutants showed reduced LPS shedding overall, they still exhibited higher LPS levels under LSMMG, suggesting that flagellar function is not solely responsible for the microgravity-induced increase. Furthermore, V. fischeri cells grown under LSMMG demonstrated increased susceptibility to cell membrane-disrupting agents, indicating a potential alteration in outer membrane integrity. These findings suggest that microgravity can alter the physiology of symbiotic microbes, potentially impacting host-microbe interactions during spaceflight.",

    "conclusions": "Modeled microgravity conditions significantly alter the physiology of the beneficial symbiont Vibrio fischeri, leading to increased LPS shedding and OMV production, and potentially compromising outer membrane integrity. These changes, observed even in motility-deficient mutants, suggest a novel response to microgravity that could impact host-microbe interactions during spaceflight.",
