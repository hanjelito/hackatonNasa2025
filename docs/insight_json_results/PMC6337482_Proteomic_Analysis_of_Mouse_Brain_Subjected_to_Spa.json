    "summary_full": "This study investigated the proteomic changes in the mouse brain after a 13-day spaceflight mission (STS-135). Brain tissue was collected within 3-5 hours of landing to analyze protein expression profiles. The analysis revealed 26 proteins with significantly altered expression in either gray or white matter. While no individual proteins overlapped between the two regions, functional categories such as synaptic plasticity, vesicular activity, protein/organelle transport, and metabolism showed common changes. The findings indicate that spaceflight induces significant alterations in protein expression related to neuronal structure and metabolic function, potentially impacting brain integrity and mission outcomes. The study highlights the need for further research into these changes and the development of countermeasures.",
