    "summary_full": "This study investigated the global transcriptional and proteomic responses of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 when grown under actual spaceflight conditions. The research aimed to assess potential alterations in virulence and identify conserved regulatory mechanisms compared to other bacteria like Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. P. aeruginosa exhibited differential regulation of 167 genes and 28 proteins in spaceflight, with the RNA binding protein Hfq identified as a key global regulator. This finding is significant as Hfq was also differentially regulated in spaceflight-grown S. Typhimurium, making it the first identified regulator common to spaceflight responses across different bacterial species. Notably, virulence-related genes such as lecA, lecB, and rhlA were induced in spaceflight. Comparisons with microgravity analogue conditions (rotating wall vessel) revealed similarities in Hfq regulation and oxygen metabolism, though spaceflight-grown bacteria appeared to adopt an anaerobic mode of growth with prominent denitrification, while analogue conditions favored microaerophilic metabolism. The study highlights the importance of understanding these responses for infectious disease risk assessment during space missions and suggests potential insights into in vivo infection processes due to the role of low-fluid-shear environments.",

    "conclusions": "Spaceflight significantly alters the transcriptional and proteomic profiles of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, with the Hfq regulator playing a central role. The bacterium appears to shift towards anaerobic metabolism, including denitrification, and upregulates key virulence factors like lectins and rhamnolipid synthesis genes. These findings are crucial for assessing infectious disease risks in space and provide insights into the role of microgravity and low-fluid-shear environments in bacterial pathogenesis, with Hfq emerging as a conserved regulator across species.",
