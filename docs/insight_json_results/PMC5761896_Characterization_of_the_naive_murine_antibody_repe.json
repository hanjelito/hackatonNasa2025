    "summary_full": "This study characterizes the naive murine antibody repertoire in C57BL/6J mice using unamplified high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of splenic tissue. Over 90,000 heavy-chain and 135,000 light-chain immunoglobulin sequences were recovered. The usage of individual V-, D-, and J-gene segments was found to be largely uniform across three pooled mouse samples, particularly for abundant segments. However, the repertoire of individual B-cell CDR3 amino acid sequences showed high variability, confirming combinatorial diversity. Some skewing in V-gene segment detection was observed, potentially related to chromosomal location. The study provides a non-primer-biased view of the unimmunized antibody repertoire, laying a foundation for future research, including studies on the effects of spaceflight on the immune system.",

    "conclusions": "This study presents the first unamplified view of the naive murine antibody repertoire, demonstrating that RNA-Seq without amplification can accurately assess V-gene usage and provide a snapshot of CDR3 sequences. The findings confirm significant combinatorial diversity in CDR3 sequences despite uniform gene segment usage and suggest potential influences of chromosomal location on V-gene expression. The data serve as a foundation for future studies on repertoire changes in response to immunization and environmental factors like spaceflight.",
    "impact_statement": "This research provides a foundational dataset and methodology for understanding the naive antibody repertoire, crucial for developing targeted immunotherapies and vaccines, and for assessing immune system health in various conditions, including spaceflight."
