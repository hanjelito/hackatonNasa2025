    "summary_full": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe lung disease in preterm infants, characterized by abnormal proliferation and differentiation of alveolar type II epithelial cells (AEC II). This study investigated the role of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells in BPD using public datasets, clinical samples, a hyperoxia-induced BPD mouse model, and an AEC II-iNKT cell co-culture system. The study found that IL-15, a factor for NKT cell development, increased in BPD patients. Clinically, peripheral blood NKT cells were elevated in BPD patients. In the mouse model, iNKT cell percentage and activation increased under hyperoxia, correlating with abnormal lung development. Inhibiting iNKT cells with anti-CD1d antibody alleviated lung injury, while activating them with α-GalCer or adoptive transfer of iNKT cells aggravated it. In vitro, iNKT cells worsened AEC II dysfunction under hyperoxia, leading to abnormal SP-C and T1α expression. RNA-seq analysis revealed that iNKT cells promoted ferroptosis in AEC II under hyperoxia, evidenced by increased ferroptosis-related gene expression and markers. This ferroptosis was accompanied by decreased SP-C and T1α expression, suggesting that iNKT cell recruitment and over-activation contribute to alveolarization disorder in BPD.",

    "conclusions": "This study demonstrates that over-activation of iNKT cells exacerbates lung injury in a mouse model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Hyperoxia leads to increased iNKT cell recruitment and activation in the lungs, which in turn promotes ferroptosis in alveolar type II epithelial cells (AEC II). This ferroptosis is associated with impaired AEC II differentiation (decreased SP-C and T1α expression), ultimately contributing to alveolarization disorder and the development of BPD. Targeting iNKT cells may offer a therapeutic avenue for BPD.",
    "impact_statement": "This research identifies over-activated iNKT cells as a key driver of lung injury in bronchopulmonary dysplasia by inducing ferroptosis in alveolar epithelial cells, suggesting a novel therapeutic target for this severe neonatal lung disease."
