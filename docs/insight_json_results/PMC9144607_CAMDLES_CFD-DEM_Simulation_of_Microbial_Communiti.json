    "summary_full": "This paper introduces CAMDLES (CFD-DEM Artificial Microgravity Developments for Living Ecosystem Simulation), a computational tool that extends CFD-DEM modeling to simulate biological flows, growth, and mass transfer of microbial communities in artificial microgravity devices like rotating wall vessel bioreactors (RWVs). The study addresses the significant impact of microgravity on microbes during spaceflight and aims to validate ground-based simulation methods. CAMDLES incorporates agent-based modeling to track inter-species metabolite transport and simultaneously models biological, chemical, and mechanical processes in a rotating reference frame. By correlating mass transfer calculations with Monod dynamic parameters, the model predicts growth rates under different gravity conditions. Simulations of a model community of Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica revealed that species colocalization in dense aggregates leads to the greatest differences in growth between microgravity, RWV, and 1g conditions. The study also examined the influence of spatial distribution, product yields, and diffusivity on growth, providing a framework for future laboratory experiments and the design of biological experiments using RWVs.",

    "conclusions": "CAMDLES provides a novel computational framework for simulating microbial communities in artificial microgravity, integrating fluid dynamics, particle dynamics, and biological growth. The simulations highlight the critical role of the physical environment, particularly spatial organization and mass transfer, in influencing microbial community behavior. While RWVs can alter growth dynamics compared to true microgravity, their precise effect is community-specific and depends on factors like diffusion and product yields. The developed model serves as a basis for hypothesis generation and experimental design, aiming to demystify inconsistencies observed in microbial studies between RWV and spaceflight microgravity conditions.",
