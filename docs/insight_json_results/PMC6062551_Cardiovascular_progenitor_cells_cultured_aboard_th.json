    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of spaceflight on human cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) by culturing neonatal and adult CPCs aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Upon return to Earth, researchers analyzed changes in microRNA and gene expression, focusing on mechanotransduction, cardiogenesis, cell cycling, DNA repair, and paracrine signaling. Spaceflight altered microRNA expression in both age groups, predicted to affect extracellular matrix interactions and Hippo signaling. Neonatal CPCs showed downregulated mechanotransduction genes (YAP1, RHOA) and upregulated cytoskeletal genes, non-canonical Wnt ligands, and Wnt/calcium signaling molecules. They also exhibited increased mesendodermal gene expression, decreased mesodermal derivative markers, reduced endothelial-like tube formation, and elevated Bmp and Tbx genes. Both neonatal and adult CPCs showed increased DNA repair and paracrine factor expression, leading to enhanced migration. Notably, only neonatal CPCs displayed increased early developmental markers and enhanced proliferative potential. These findings suggest that spaceflight can induce beneficial changes for cardiac repair, and mimicking these effects on Earth could be a promising therapeutic strategy.",

    "conclusions": "Spaceflight significantly alters the developmental status, proliferative potential, and migratory ability of cardiovascular progenitor cells (CPCs) in an age-dependent manner. Neonatal CPCs show a greater shift towards an earlier developmental state with enhanced proliferation, while both age groups exhibit improved migration. These findings suggest that spaceflight induces changes that could be therapeutically beneficial for cardiac repair on Earth and highlight the need to understand these adaptations for astronaut health.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals that spaceflight can enhance the regenerative potential of cardiovascular progenitor cells, offering new avenues for cardiac repair therapies on Earth and informing strategies for maintaining astronaut cardiovascular health during long-duration space missions."
