    "document_title": "Fifteen Days Microgravity Causes Growth in Calvaria of Mice",
    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of 15 days of microgravity on the calvaria (skull bones) of mice, hypothesizing that headward fluid shifts during spaceflight might cause bone growth in non-weight-bearing areas. Seven mice were exposed to microgravity on the STS-131 mission, while eight served as ground controls. Micro-computed tomography was used to analyze bone volume (BV), cross-sectional thickness (CsTh), and tissue mineral density (TMD). The results showed a statistically significant increase in BV in the spaceflight group compared to the ground control group (10.48% vs. 9.64%, p<0.05). A trend towards increased CsTh was also observed, though TMD remained similar between groups. These findings suggest that microgravity can induce adaptive bone remodeling in calvarial bones, potentially driven by fluid shifts independent of skeletal loading.",
