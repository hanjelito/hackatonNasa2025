    "summary_full": "This study investigated the impact of spaceflight on the gut microbiome of mice using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The researchers found that spaceflight led to increased alpha diversity and altered microbial community structure. Using a novel tool called STARMAPs, they confirmed that these changes were reproducible across different space missions but not mimicked by Earth-based radiation studies, suggesting factors other than radiation are responsible. Specific microbial taxa were found to be differentially abundant, with an increased Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratio observed. Functional analysis inferred altered microbial gene abundance, indicating a shift in energy metabolism, particularly a decrease in amine degradation pathways and an increase in fermentation pathways. Integration with host liver transcriptomic data revealed correlations between microbial metabolic pathways and host gene expression, notably highlighting a potential link between decreased microbial putrescine degradation and host protein metabolism. The findings suggest that spaceflight significantly impacts the gut microbiome and host metabolism, with potential implications for astronaut health.",

    "conclusions": "Spaceflight robustly affects the gut microbiome, likely due to factors such as microgravity, leading to altered microbial community structure and inferred metabolic capabilities. These changes are associated with host liver gene expression, suggesting a coordinated shift in microbial and host metabolism. These findings are crucial for understanding mammalian adaptation to space and for developing strategies to maintain crew health during long-duration missions.",
