    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effect of four types of radiation (gamma rays, protons, carbon ions, and iron ions) on the reactivation of latent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the Akata cell line. The researchers exposed latently infected cells to doses ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 Gy and observed that all radiation types induced lytic gene transcription and significantly increased viral loads compared to controls, with effects detectable as early as four days post-exposure. While gamma rays generally showed higher initial reactivation rates, high-energy particles induced more sustained and later reactivation. The study also found that cell viability and size were variably affected by radiation, with no consistent trend across all types and doses. Importantly, these results demonstrate that radiation alone, independent of immune system changes, can trigger EBV reactivation, challenging the standard relative biological effectiveness (RBE) concept in radiobiology for this specific endpoint.",

    "conclusions": "Exposure to gamma rays, protons, carbon ions, and iron ions at doses of 0.1 to 2.0 Gy can induce EBV lytic gene transcription and reactivation in latently infected cells, independent of immune system factors. While gamma rays showed higher initial reactivation, high-energy particles induced more sustained reactivation. These findings suggest that radiation itself is a significant factor in viral reactivation and challenge the standard RBE concept for this biological endpoint.",
    "impact_statement": "This research demonstrates that space radiation can directly reactivate latent viruses like EBV, posing a significant health risk to astronauts and highlighting the need for better radiation protection and understanding of viral reactivation mechanisms in space and during medical radiation treatments."
