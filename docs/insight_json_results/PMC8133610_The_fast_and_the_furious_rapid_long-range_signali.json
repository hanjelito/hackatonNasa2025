    "document_title": "The fast and the furious: rapid long-range signaling in plants",
    "summary_full": "Plants possess a sophisticated systemic signaling system that allows local stimuli to elicit rapid, plant-wide responses. This communication network involves not only chemical messengers like RNAs, peptides, hormones, and metabolites but also a faster system utilizing electrical, Ca2+, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) signals. These rapid signals can propagate across many cells per second, with researchers identifying key molecular components such as NADPH oxidases and various ion channels (two pore, glutamate receptor-like, cyclic nucleotide gated) involved in their transmission. Upon reaching distant targets, these signals trigger responses including hormone production, metabolic shifts, and changes in gene expression, all occurring within seconds to minutes. This enables plants to mount preemptive defenses, such as against insect herbivory, even before the threat fully spreads.",

This network relies on electrical, Ca2+, and ROS signals, mediated by specific ion channels and oxidases, enabling swift communication across tissues. While significant progress has been made in identifying key molecular components, many questions remain regarding the precise mechanisms, information encoding, and interplay of these signaling pathways.",
