    "summary_full": "This review discusses the interconnectedness of gravitropism and phototropism in plants, focusing on their molecular mechanisms and the impact of microgravity. Both tropisms involve directed growth responses to environmental stimuli, with gravity sensed by specialized cells (statocytes) and light by photoreceptors (phototropins). Microgravity disrupts meristematic competence, uncoupling cell proliferation and growth, and affecting cell cycle regulation and ribosome biogenesis. Light, particularly red light mediated by phytochromes, has an activating effect on these processes. Auxin is identified as a key mediator in these alterations. Future experiments on the International Space Station aim to further elucidate these mechanisms and molecular players, particularly in understanding how light and gravity interact to influence plant development and cell cycle regulation, with implications for plant growth in space environments.",

    "conclusions": "The interplay between light and gravity significantly influences plant development by modulating meristematic cell functions, including proliferation and growth. Microgravity disrupts this balance, leading to uncoupled cell growth and division, while light, particularly red light, can act as a countermeasure. Auxin is a central mediator in these responses. Future space-based experiments are crucial for a deeper understanding of these complex interactions and for developing strategies to support plant growth in extraterrestrial environments.",
    "impact_statement": "This research provides critical insights into how plants sense and respond to fundamental environmental cues like light and gravity, with direct implications for optimizing plant growth in space for future exploration and colonization."
