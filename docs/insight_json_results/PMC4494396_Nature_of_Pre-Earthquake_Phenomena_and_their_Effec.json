    "summary_full": "This paper proposes a new physical mechanism for pre-earthquake phenomena, focusing on the activation of \"positive holes\" (highly mobile electronic charge carriers) in stressed rocks deep within the Earth's crust. As these positive holes flow out of stressed regions, they generate ultralow and extremely low frequency (ULF/ELF) electromagnetic waves and can cause air ionization and oxidation of water to hydrogen peroxide upon reaching the Earth's surface or water bodies. These physical and chemical changes are hypothesized to be the stimuli that trigger unusual animal behavior observed before earthquakes. The paper discusses how ULF/ELF waves can affect biological processes through resonance with cellular redox cycles, leading to oxidative stress. It also details how air ionization can alter stress hormone levels and how hydrogen peroxide formation can impact aquatic life. Furthermore, the release of gases like ozone and carbon monoxide due to these processes is explored as another potential factor influencing animal behavior. The authors argue that this \"positive hole\" model provides a unified explanation for various reported pre-earthquake phenomena, challenging the mainstream seismological view that earthquakes are unpredictable and that animal behavior is purely anecdotal.",
