    "summary_full": "This review synthesizes findings from transcriptomics and specific NF-κB pathway studies to understand the molecular impacts of spaceflight on human health. Spaceflight, characterized by microgravity and radiation, poses risks like bone loss, immune dysfunction, muscle atrophy, and CNS issues. The NF-κB pathway is frequently implicated across various cell types and tissues under simulated or actual spaceflight conditions. While its activation or inhibition varies by cell type, the overall health impact appears negative. The review highlights how omics data can identify affected pathways, leading to potential countermeasures. Studies using gene-deficient models suggest that manipulating NF-κB could mitigate bone and muscle loss. Further research into NF-κB is crucial for crew health.",

    "conclusions": "The NF-κB pathway is significantly altered by spaceflight stressors like microgravity and radiation, contributing to various detrimental health consequences. While the specific response (activation or inhibition) varies by cell type, the overall impact on crew health is negative. Manipulating the NF-κB pathway holds promise as a countermeasure for spaceflight-induced bone and muscle loss, and further research is warranted to fully understand its role and develop effective interventions.",
    "impact_statement": "This review consolidates evidence linking the NF-κB pathway to multiple spaceflight-related health risks, providing a molecular basis for understanding and mitigating these challenges for future human space exploration."
