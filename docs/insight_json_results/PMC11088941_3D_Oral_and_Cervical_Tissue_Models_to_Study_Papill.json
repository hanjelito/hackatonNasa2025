    "summary_full": "This protocol describes two complementary methods for generating 3D epithelial tissue models that mimic oral and cervical tissues, crucial for studying human papillomavirus (HPV) interactions. The first method involves growing primary human epithelial cells on a dermal equivalent (collagen and fibroblasts) at an air-liquid interface to achieve stratification. The second method utilizes a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor, where cells self-assemble into 3D aggregates on collagen-coated microbeads in a low-shear microgravity environment. Both methods are applied to HPV-positive and -negative oral and cervical cells. The protocol details procedures for cell isolation, monolayer culture, HPV screening, 3D tissue generation (organotypic raft and RWV), and subsequent characterization using microscopy (histology, SEM, immunofluorescence) and omics studies (RNA extraction, RT-qPCR). These models aim to provide insights into epithelial biology, the HPV life cycle, and host-pathogen interactions.",

    "conclusions": "The study presents detailed protocols for establishing and analyzing two types of 3D epithelial tissue models (organotypic raft and RWV bioreactor) that accurately mimic oral and cervical tissues. These models are essential for studying the differentiation-dependent life cycle of HPV and host-pathogen interactions, offering a more physiologically relevant alternative to traditional 2D cultures and potentially complementing animal models.",
