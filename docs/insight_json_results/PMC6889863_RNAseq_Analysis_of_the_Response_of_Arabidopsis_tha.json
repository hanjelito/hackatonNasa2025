    "summary_full": "This study investigated the transcriptomic response of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings to various fractional gravity levels (microgravity to 1g) during spaceflight on the ISS, under blue-light stimulation. While only one gene (VPS28-1) was differentially expressed across all gravity conditions with stringent FDR correction, a set of 14 genes consistently appeared differentially expressed when comparing microgravity, low-g, or Moon-g levels to 1g. Gene Ontology analysis revealed distinct responses at different gravity levels: light and photosynthesis under microgravity, general stress and hormone responses at low-g, and cell wall/membrane structure and function at Moon-g. The findings suggest that root blue-light phototropism may mitigate gravitational stress in microgravity, and that conflicting tropistic cues at low-g induce a significant stress response. Cell wall/membrane remodeling was observed at Moon to Mars gravity levels, potentially related to graviresistance mechanisms. The study highlights the complex interplay of gravity and light in plant development and adaptation in space.",

    "conclusions": "The study demonstrates that blue-light phototropism in Arabidopsis roots can partially compensate for the lack of gravitropism in microgravity, leading to reduced transcriptional changes. Increasing gravity levels gradually restore a near-normal transcriptional state, with distinct responses observed at different fractional gravity levels. At low-g, conflicting tropistic stimuli induce a stress response, while at Moon-g, cell wall and membrane remodeling is prominent, potentially related to graviresistance. These findings contribute to understanding plant adaptation to altered gravity and are relevant for developing bioregenerative life support systems for future space exploration.",
    "impact_statement": "This research provides crucial insights into how plants respond to fractional gravity and light, informing the development of plant-based life support systems for long-duration space missions."
