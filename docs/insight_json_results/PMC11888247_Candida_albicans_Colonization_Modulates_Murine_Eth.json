    "summary_full": "This study investigates the impact of Candida albicans (C. albicans) colonization in the gastrointestinal tract on ethanol consumption and behavior in mice. C. albicans is a common commensal yeast that can bloom in individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD). The researchers found that mice colonized with C. albicans showed reduced ethanol consumption and preference. This reduction was associated with elevated serum prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels, and blocking PGE2 receptors reversed the effect. Conversely, injecting mice with a PGE2 derivative decreased their ethanol preference, indicating PGE2's role in this phenotype. Furthermore, C. albicans colonization altered dopamine receptor transcription in the dorsal striatum, leading to faster acquisition of ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion and increased susceptibility to ethanol's motor coordination impairments. These effects were partially reversed by PGE2 receptor antagonists. The study highlights C. albicans as a fungal microbiome member that influences ethanol preference and demonstrates the involvement of PGE2 signaling in these behaviors, suggesting a link between fungal gut colonization and AUD-related phenotypes.",

    "conclusions": "This study demonstrates that gastrointestinal colonization by Candida albicans in mice leads to reduced ethanol consumption and preference, mediated by elevated serum PGE2 levels acting on EP1 and EP2 receptors. These changes are associated with alterations in striatal dopamine receptor expression and increased susceptibility to ethanol's behavioral effects, including conditioned taste aversion and motor impairment. The findings highlight a novel link between fungal gut microbiome composition and alcohol-related behaviors, implicating the gut-brain axis and PGE2 signaling as key players.",
    "impact_statement": "This research identifies a fungal gut microbe, Candida albicans, as a modulator of ethanol consumption and behavior through prostaglandin E2 signaling, offering potential new therapeutic targets for alcohol use disorder."
