    "summary_full": "This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying root skewing in Arabidopsis thaliana by comparing gene expression profiles of two ecotypes, WS and Col-0, under different tilted growth conditions. Roots exhibit skewing and waving when grown on tilted surfaces, with WS showing significant skewing and waving, while Col-0 primarily waves. By analyzing transcriptome data from roots grown at various angles (Agp 45°, 135°, and 90° as control), the researchers identified 11 candidate genes highly probable to be involved in root skewing. These genes are associated with environmental sensing pathways, including sugar transport, salt signaling, hormone signaling, and darkness responses, suggesting that the integration of various environmental signals drives root skewing behavior. The findings indicate that skewing is primarily controlled by signaling and perception mechanisms rather than direct physical restructuring.",

    "conclusions": "This study identified 11 highly probable skew gene candidates (HPSGC) by comparing transcriptomic data from Arabidopsis ecotypes WS and Col-0 under different tilted growth conditions. These genes are predominantly involved in environmental sensing pathways (salt, sugar, hormones, darkness) and upstream signaling processes, suggesting that root skewing is driven by the integration of various environmental signals. The findings highlight the role of signaling and perception mechanisms in controlling root directionality, rather than direct physical changes in root structure.",
