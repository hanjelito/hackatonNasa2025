    "summary_full": "This paper presents a novel protocol for synchronizing Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) embryos using mesh filters, offering an alternative to the traditional bleach synchronization method. The bleach method, while common, can harm embryos and requires careful control of parameters. Microfluidic devices offer precise separation but are expensive and not easily scalable. The developed mesh filtration technique exploits size differences between C. elegans developmental stages to isolate embryos. Using sequential filtration with 40 µm and 20 µm mesh filters, the researchers achieved a higher yield of embryos per plate compared to bleach synchronization. They also optimized conditions by incorporating polyethylene glycol (PEG) into the M9 buffer to improve embryo pelleting and yield. Importantly, embryos collected via filtration showed no deleterious effects on downstream larval development assays and responded similarly to an anthelmintic drug as those obtained by bleaching. This method provides a scalable, cost-effective, and less harmful approach for obtaining synchronized C. elegans embryos for high-throughput assays.",
