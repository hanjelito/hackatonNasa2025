    "document_title": "Draft Genome Sequences of Two Aspergillus fumigatus Strains, Isolated from the International Space Station",
    "summary_full": "This study presents the draft genome sequences of two Aspergillus fumigatus strains, ISSFT-021 and IF1SW-F4, isolated from the International Space Station (ISS). These strains were previously found to be significantly more lethal in a zebrafish model and more resistant to UV radiation compared to clinical isolates. The genome sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq2500, and the resulting reads were assembled using the MaSuRCA genome assembler. The draft genome of ISSFT-021 consists of 301 scaffolds totaling 28.5 Mb, while IF1SW-F4 has 208 scaffolds totaling 28.2 Mb. These sequences are deposited in public databases and aim to facilitate investigations into the molecular mechanisms behind the enhanced virulence and radiation resistance of ISS-isolated A. fumigatus strains, which could inform countermeasures for astronaut health.",
