    "document_title": "Cosmic kidney disease: an integrated pan-omic, physiological and morphological study into spaceflight-induced renal dysfunction",
    "summary_full": "This study investigates the health consequences of spaceflight, specifically microgravity and galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), on the kidney, an organ largely unexplored in the context of long-duration missions. Using a comprehensive pan-omic approach (epigenomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, epiproteomic, metabolomic, metagenomic) combined with clinical chemistry and morphometry from multiple human and rodent spaceflight missions and simulations, the research reveals significant kidney alterations. Key findings include dephosphorylation of renal transporters, suggesting a primary renal contribution to nephrolithiasis risk beyond bone loss. The study also identified nephron remodeling, characterized by enlarged distal convoluted tubules and reduced overall tubule density. Furthermore, exposure to simulated GCR equivalent to a Mars roundtrip dose induced renal damage and dysfunction. These findings highlight the critical need for countermeasures to protect kidney health during deep space exploration.",

    "conclusions": "Spaceflight, encompassing both microgravity and GCR, induces significant structural and functional changes in the kidney, including transporter dephosphorylation and nephron remodeling, which likely contribute to the increased risk of kidney stone formation. Simulated GCR exposure causes acute and chronic renal damage, particularly affecting the vasculature and tubules. These findings underscore the critical need for countermeasures to protect kidney health for long-duration space missions.",
    "impact_statement": "This study provides crucial insights into the detrimental effects of spaceflight on kidney health, identifying specific molecular and structural changes that increase risks for astronauts and informing the development of essential countermeasures for future deep space missions."
