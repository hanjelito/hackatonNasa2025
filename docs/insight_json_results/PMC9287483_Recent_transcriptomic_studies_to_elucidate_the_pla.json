    "summary_full": "This review synthesizes transcriptomic studies on plant adaptation to spaceflight and simulated space environments, focusing on altered gravity and cosmic radiation. Common altered processes identified across studies include cell wall remodeling, oxidative stress, defense responses, and photosynthesis. European contributions highlighted include the role of red light in adaptation and cellular response mechanisms affecting cell cycle regulation. The review details experiments using various hardware like BRIC, TAGES, and EMCS, analyzing gene expression changes in Arabidopsis thaliana and other species. Key findings indicate that light is crucial for plant development in space, and that genotype, organ specificity, and environmental conditions significantly influence adaptive responses. Molecular mechanisms such as DNA methylation and alternative splicing are also implicated. The research underscores the importance of understanding these adaptations for supporting human space exploration and establishing bioregenerative life support systems.",
