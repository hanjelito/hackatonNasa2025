    "document_title": "Spaceflight decelerates the epigenetic clock orchestrated with a global alteration in DNA methylome and transcriptome in the mouse retina",
    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of spaceflight on the mouse retina by analyzing DNA methylome and transcriptome changes after a 37-day mission on the International Space Station. The researchers found significant alterations in DNA methylation patterns, with a large number of genes being differentially methylated, while fewer genes showed differential expression at the transcriptome level. Several biological pathways associated with retinal diseases, such as macular degeneration, were found to be altered. Notably, spaceflight decelerated the epigenetic clock in the mouse retina, suggesting a slower biological aging process in this tissue. These findings indicate that spaceflight impacts retinal epigenomics and transcriptomics, potentially contributing to eye-related disorders observed in astronauts.",

    "conclusions": "Spaceflight induces significant changes in the DNA methylome and transcriptome of the mouse retina, affecting pathways related to retinal diseases. A key finding is the deceleration of the retinal epigenetic clock, suggesting a slower biological aging process in space. These alterations highlight potential mechanisms underlying vision impairment in astronauts and underscore the need for further research into the long-term effects of space travel on ocular health.",
    "impact_statement": "This study provides critical insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying spaceflight-induced retinal changes and offers a potential explanation for visual impairments experienced by astronauts by demonstrating spaceflight's impact on retinal epigenetics and gene expression, including a deceleration of biological aging."
