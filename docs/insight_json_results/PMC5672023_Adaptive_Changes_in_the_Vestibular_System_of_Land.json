    "summary_full": "This study investigated the adaptive changes in the vestibular system of the land snail Helix lucorum after a 30-day spaceflight on the Bion-M1 satellite. Researchers examined geotactic behavior, statocyst transcriptome, and electrophysiological responses to tilts. The findings revealed plastic changes in the snail's vestibular system due to spaceflight, with the absence of light also impacting statocyst physiology. Readaptation to normal tilt responses occurred approximately 20 hours after returning to Earth, demonstrating the snail's compensatory response to gravity loss and subsequent restoration. The study utilized various control groups and advanced analytical techniques, including SEM, RNA-Seq, and electrophysiology, to support its conclusions.",

    "conclusions": "The study demonstrates that the land snail's vestibular system undergoes significant plastic changes in response to 30 days of microgravity, affecting its behavior and neural function. These changes include altered gravitactic responses and hypersensitivity of statocyst neurons. The system shows a remarkable capacity for readaptation to Earth's gravity within approximately 20 hours, highlighting the dynamic nature of sensory adaptation. The absence of light also plays a role in statocyst physiology, independent of microgravity.",
    "impact_statement": "This research provides crucial insights into the adaptive capabilities and readaptation processes of gravity-sensing systems in response to spaceflight, relevant for understanding human space adaptation and potential countermeasures."
