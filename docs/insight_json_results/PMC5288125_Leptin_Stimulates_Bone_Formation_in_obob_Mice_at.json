    "summary_full": "This study investigated the differential effects of leptin on bone formation and energy metabolism in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice. Leptin was infused at various doses to determine dose-response relationships. Results showed that lower leptin infusion rates (7-17 ng/h) significantly increased bone formation parameters, including osteoblast activity and bone formation rate, with minimal effects on energy metabolism markers like UCP-1 gene expression and food intake. Higher doses (40-80 ng/h) were required to impact energy metabolism. Gene expression analysis in tibia revealed robust changes in Jak/Stat signaling and bone-related genes at low leptin doses, while the hypothalamus showed minimal changes. Higher leptin doses induced significant gene expression changes in the hypothalamus. The findings suggest that leptin acts peripherally to promote bone acquisition, and the limited transport of leptin across the blood-brain barrier ensures that its bone-promoting actions are not overridden by its central anorexigenic effects.",

    "conclusions": "Leptin stimulates bone formation at doses that have minimal impact on energy metabolism, suggesting a peripheral action of leptin on bone. The limited transport of leptin across the blood-brain barrier ensures that its bone-growth-promoting actions are not curtailed by its central anorexigenic effects, thereby coupling bone acquisition to energy availability.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals that leptin plays a critical role in bone formation through peripheral signaling, offering potential therapeutic targets for bone diseases by dissociating bone anabolism from appetite regulation."
