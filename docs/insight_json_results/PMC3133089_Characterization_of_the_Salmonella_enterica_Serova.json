    "summary_full": "This study characterizes the previously uncharacterized Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium gene ydcI (STM1625), identifying it as a conserved DNA binding protein belonging to the LysR family. The ydcI gene is expressed across various Gram-negative genera and autoregulates its own expression in S. Typhimurium. Purified YdcI protein specifically binds to its own promoter sequence. A Î”ydcI mutant strain exhibited increased sensitivity to both organic and inorganic acid stress, a defect that was complemented in trans. The ydcI gene was found to be part of the rpoS regulon, crucial for stress resistance. While the mutant showed no difference in invasion of cultured cells, induction of ydcI expression led to a 2.8-fold increase in invasion and induced biofilm formation in stationary-phase cultures. These findings suggest ydcI plays a role in stress resistance and potentially virulence.",

    "conclusions": "The Salmonella Typhimurium ydcI gene encodes a conserved DNA binding protein that is essential for full acid stress resistance and is part of the rpoS regulon. Its induction can enhance bacterial invasion of host cells and promote biofilm formation, suggesting a role in virulence and adaptation. YdcI acts as a transcriptional regulator, influencing various aspects of bacterial physiology.",
    "impact_statement": "This study identifies a novel regulator, YdcI, that enhances Salmonella's resistance to acid stress and potentially its virulence, offering new insights into bacterial survival mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets."
