    "summary_full": "This study investigated the human microbiome and immune response changes in four individuals during a three-day spaceflight mission using a longitudinal multi-omics approach. By analyzing metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and single-nuclei immune cell profiling across 750 samples from 10 body sites, the researchers characterized time-dependent microbial shifts. Most alterations were transient, with viruses increasing on skin sites during flight. However, the oral microbiome showed longer-term shifts, including an increase in plaque-associated bacteria like Fusobacteriota, which correlated with immune cell gene expression. Microbial genes related to phage activity, toxin-antitoxin systems, and stress response were enriched across multiple body sites. The findings provide an in-depth characterization of microbiome and immune response shifts during short-term spaceflight, offering insights for future mission planning and spacecraft design.",

    "conclusions": "Short-term spaceflight induces significant, though largely transient, shifts in the human microbiome across multiple body sites, with notable longer-term changes in the oral microbiome. These microbial alterations are associated with changes in host immune cell gene expression, suggesting a complex interplay between the microbiome, the space environment, and astronaut health. The findings highlight the need for continued monitoring and potential modulation of the microbiome for maintaining astronaut health during space missions.",
    "impact_statement": "This study provides a comprehensive multi-omics view of how short-term spaceflight impacts the human microbiome and immune system, crucial for ensuring astronaut health in the era of commercial space travel."
