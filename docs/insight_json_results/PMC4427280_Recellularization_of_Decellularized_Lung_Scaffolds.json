    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effectiveness of a dynamic suspension culture system, the rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor, for repopulating decellularized mouse lung scaffolds with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and alveolar type II cells (C10). Compared to static culture conditions, the RWV bioreactor resulted in significantly higher cell numbers, decreased apoptosis, increased proliferation, and enhanced total RNA levels in the recellularized scaffolds. Gene expression and immunohistochemical analyses indicated that MSCs cultured in the RWV bioreactor showed signs of differentiation into collagen I-producing fibroblast-like cells, suggesting an improved potential for remodeling the decellularized scaffold matrix. The study concludes that dynamic suspension culture is a promising method for enhancing the repopulation of decellularized lungs, potentially contributing to scaffold remodeling and influencing cell differentiation and functionality.",

    "conclusions": "Dynamic suspension culture using a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor significantly enhances the repopulation of decellularized lung scaffolds with both mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and alveolar type II cells (C10) compared to static culture. This method improves cell viability, proliferation, and RNA content, and promotes MSC differentiation towards a fibroblast-like phenotype, suggesting a greater capacity for extracellular matrix remodeling. These findings indicate that RWV culture is a promising approach for improving the engineering of functional lung tissue from decellularized scaffolds.",
