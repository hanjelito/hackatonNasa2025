    "summary_full": "This study investigates the survival and molecular responses of filamentous fungi, specifically strains isolated from Chernobyl and the International Space Station (ISS), when exposed to simulated Mars conditions (SMC). The research is the first to examine fungal conidia in monolayers under SMC. Several fungal strains were tested for their sensitivity to UV-C and SMC, revealing strain-dependent survival rates. Two strains, ISSFT-021-30 and IMV 00236-30, survived a 30-minute exposure to SMC and were further analyzed. Proteomic analysis showed differential expression of proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis, translation, and carbohydrate metabolism in the SMC-exposed strains. However, no significant alterations were observed in their metabolomes. Notably, conidia of the ISS-isolated strain ISSFT-021 that were exposed to SMC exhibited enhanced resistance to subsequent UV-C irradiation compared to unexposed conidia. The findings suggest that fungi possess remarkable adaptability to extreme extraterrestrial environments and highlight their potential as a forward contamination source in space exploration.",

    "conclusions": "Filamentous fungi exhibit significant adaptability to simulated Mars conditions, with certain strains surviving exposure and undergoing proteomic changes related to essential cellular processes. The observed increase in UV-C resistance after SMC exposure suggests an adaptive mechanism that could be crucial for survival in extraterrestrial environments. These findings underscore the importance of considering fungi as potential contaminants in planetary protection protocols and highlight their resilience for future space exploration.",
