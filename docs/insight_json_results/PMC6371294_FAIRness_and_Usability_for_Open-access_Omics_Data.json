    "summary_full": "This study assesses the FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, Reusability) of NASA's GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) and four similar omics data systems using 14 metrics. The systems performed best in findability and accessibility, and worst in interoperability, with metadata reusability being a particular weakness. The authors encountered challenges implementing semantic integration for federated querying due to interoperability shortcomings. They propose two new principles for Big Data system developers to maximize data accessibility and usability, emphasizing the need for clear policies on credentialing and authentication, and suggesting collocation of data and executable code. The study highlights the importance of community-developed semantic resources for improving metadata richness and enabling better data integration across systems.",

    "conclusions": "Current omics data systems exhibit significant shortcomings in data interoperability, particularly in the use of semantic languages and community-developed vocabularies for metadata. While findability and accessibility are relatively strong, the lack of robust interoperability hinders data integration and reuse. The authors propose new principles focused on integrated credentialing architectures and data-code collocation to improve usability and accessibility, emphasizing the need for community-driven development of semantic resources to overcome these challenges.",
    "impact_statement": "This study provides a critical assessment of FAIRness in omics data systems, identifying key areas for improvement and proposing actionable principles to enhance data accessibility and usability, which is crucial for advancing biological research and discovery."
