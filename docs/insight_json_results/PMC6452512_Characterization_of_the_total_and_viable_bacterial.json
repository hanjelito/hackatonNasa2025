    "summary_full": "This study comprehensively characterized the bacterial and fungal communities on International Space Station (ISS) surfaces using both culture-based and molecular methods. Samples were collected from eight locations over three flight missions spanning 14 months. The research aimed to differentiate between total and viable (intact cell membrane) microbial populations by employing propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment before DNA extraction. Results showed a diverse microbial community, with bacterial and fungal loads varying by location and changing over time, though spatial distribution remained relatively consistent. Dominant organisms were associated with the human microbiome, including potential opportunistic pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus and Pantoea species. Approximately 46% of viable bacteria and 40% of viable fungi could be cultured, a higher percentage than observed in Earth-based cleanrooms. The ISS microbiome showed similarities to other built environments on Earth, particularly animal skin surfaces, rather than soil. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the ISS microbiome for crew health and safety, and for developing effective microbial control strategies for long-duration space missions and terrestrial applications in controlled environments.",

    "conclusions": "The ISS harbors a diverse and dynamic bacterial and fungal community on its surfaces, which changes over time but is spatially consistent. A significant portion of these microbes are viable, and many are associated with the human microbiome, including potential opportunistic pathogens. These findings provide a crucial baseline for understanding the ISS microbiome, informing the development of safety protocols for deep space habitation, and have implications for managing microbial contamination in terrestrial controlled environments.",
    "impact_statement": "This study provides the first comprehensive catalog of viable bacteria and fungi on ISS surfaces, crucial for ensuring crew health and safety during long-duration space missions and informing microbial control strategies in critical terrestrial environments."
