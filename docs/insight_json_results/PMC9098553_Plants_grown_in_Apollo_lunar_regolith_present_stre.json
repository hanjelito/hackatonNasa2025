    "summary_full": "This study investigated the ability of terrestrial plants (Arabidopsis thaliana) to grow in actual lunar regolith samples from Apollo missions 11, 12, and 17, using a simulated lunar habitat. While plants germinated and grew, their development was slower and exhibited more stress morphologies compared to plants grown in a lunar simulant (JSC-1A). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that plants in lunar regolith differentially expressed genes associated with ionic stresses, including salt, metal, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), indicating a significant stress response. Even plants that appeared to grow more successfully showed these stress-associated gene expressions. The findings suggest that while lunar regolith can be used as a substrate for plant growth in lunar habitats, it is not a benign environment and requires further understanding and mitigation strategies for efficient life support.",
