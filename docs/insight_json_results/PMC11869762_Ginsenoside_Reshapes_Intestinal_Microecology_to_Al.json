    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of Ginseng Total Saponins (GTSs) on intestinal homeostasis disruption caused by simulated microgravity using a hindlimb suspension (HLS) rat model. The research found that GTSs intervention effectively mitigated intestinal injury, evidenced by reduced pathological damage, increased tight junction protein expression, and decreased inflammatory factors. GTSs also restored intestinal immunity-related gene levels and remodeled the gut microbiota, notably increasing the abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) metabolism-related bacteria and consequently boosting propionic and butyric acid levels. The findings suggest that GTSs improve microecological disorders and impaired immune function induced by weightlessness, potentially through an \"intestinal immune - microbiota - metabolic\" pathway, providing a basis for developing GTSs-based space health products.",
