    "summary_full": "This study investigates the effects of spaceflight on the nervous system of adult Caenorhabditis elegans. Animals that spent five days of adulthood on the International Space Station (ISS) showed hyperbranching in PVD and touch receptor neurons, indicating morphological remodeling. Furthermore, under conditions of neuronal proteotoxic stress (mCherry overexpression), spaceflight led to a significant accumulation of neuronal debris in surrounding tissues, suggesting an impaired transcellular degradation of extruded neuronal waste. These findings highlight that spaceflight can impact adult neuronal structure and the clearance of neuronal trash, underscoring the need for careful assessment of long-duration spaceflight risks to the nervous system and the development of countermeasures.",

    "conclusions": "Spaceflight significantly alters adult neuronal morphology in C. elegans, leading to hyperbranching and disorganization. Furthermore, it impairs the clearance of neuronal debris when neurons are under proteotoxic stress, resulting in accumulation of waste in surrounding tissues. These findings suggest that spaceflight poses risks to neuronal health by affecting both structure and waste management, necessitating further research and countermeasures for long-duration missions.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals that spaceflight can negatively impact neuronal structure and waste clearance mechanisms in adult organisms, highlighting potential risks for nervous system health during long-duration space exploration."
