    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of unloading on the enthesis, the bone-tendon interface, in adult mouse shoulders. After 21 days of paralysis induced by botulinum toxin A, unloading significantly increased mechanical failure and caused structural changes across multiple scales. At the millimeter scale, bone loss was observed. At the micrometer scale, bioapatite crystal size and crystallographic alignment decreased. At the nanometer scale, compositional changes stiffened the bioapatite/collagen composite. Mathematical modeling and mechanical testing indicated that these combined factors increased local stress and reduced the tissue's energy absorption capacity, thereby increasing injury risk. These findings highlight the hierarchical features of structure and composition that contribute to enthesis resilience and provide insights into developing targeted therapeutic approaches.",

    "conclusions": "Even short-term unloading of the adult enthesis leads to significant structural changes across multiple hierarchical scales, compromising its mechanical integrity and increasing the risk and extent of failure. These changes include bone loss, altered mineral crystal structure and composition, and reduced energy absorption capacity. Understanding these multiscale effects is crucial for developing effective treatments for injuries related to disuse, paralysis, and spaceflight.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals how unloading compromises the structural integrity of the bone-tendon interface at multiple scales, providing critical insights for preventing and treating injuries common in conditions like paralysis and spaceflight."
