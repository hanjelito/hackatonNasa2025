    "summary_full": "This study aimed to engineer mechanically functional cartilage constructs in vitro using adult human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) and 3D-woven poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds. The researchers investigated the effects of scaffold structure (loosely vs. tightly woven), culture vessel (static dish vs. oscillating bioreactor), and medium composition (with or without serum and chondrogenic additives) on construct properties. Results showed that tightly woven PCL scaffolds cultured in oscillating bioreactors with chondrogenic additives (but without serum) yielded constructs with mechanical properties approaching those of normal articular cartilage within 21 days. Histological and biochemical analyses confirmed chondrogenesis, with cells forming a hyaline-like matrix rich in collagen type II and GAG. The study demonstrates the feasibility of creating functional cartilage tissue engineering constructs using hMSCs and 3D-woven PCL scaffolds.",

    "conclusions": "This study successfully demonstrated the in vitro generation of mechanically functional cartilage tissue engineered from adult human mesenchymal stem cells and 3D-woven PCL scaffolds within 21 days. The combination of tightly woven scaffolds, oscillating bioreactors, and serum-free chondrogenic medium significantly enhanced construct properties, achieving mechanical moduli comparable to native articular cartilage. These findings highlight the potential of this approach for cartilage repair.",
