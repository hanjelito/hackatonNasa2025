    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of 3 months of high-dose fish oil supplementation on inflammation, endothelial function, and walking ability in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). The OMEGA-PAD II trial was a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study involving 24 patients. While there were no significant changes in inflammatory markers (hsCRP), endothelial function (flow-mediated vasodilation), or walking ability (walking impairment questionnaire, 6-min walk test), the fish oil group showed a significant increase in the omega-3 index. Furthermore, plasma levels of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs), including lipoxin A5 and resolvin E3, significantly increased in the fish oil group compared to placebo. These findings suggest that fish oil supplementation increases SPMs in PAD patients, though further research is needed to determine if these changes lead to clinical improvements.",

    "conclusions": "Three months of high-dose fish oil supplementation in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) significantly increased the omega-3 index and plasma levels of specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs) and their biosynthetic pathway markers. However, no significant improvements were observed in inflammatory markers, endothelial function, or walking ability. Further studies are required to determine if these biochemical changes lead to clinical benefits in PAD patients.",
    "impact_statement": "This study demonstrates that fish oil supplementation increases pro-resolving lipid mediators in patients with peripheral artery disease, suggesting a potential mechanism for therapeutic intervention in this condition."
