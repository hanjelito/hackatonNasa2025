    "summary_full": "This study investigates the role of estrogen receptors (ERs) in the contrasting longitudinal bone growth patterns observed in leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice. Ob/ob mice exhibit shorter femoral length and longer spinal length compared to wild-type (WT) mice. The researchers found contrasting expression patterns of chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy markers in the femur and spine growth plates of ob/ob mice. Spearman's analysis indicated a positive correlation between body length and ERα expression in the growth plate. Treatment with ERα and ERβ antagonists in ob/ob mice did not yield the expected regulatory effects on longitudinal bone growth, suggesting that leptin deficiency blunts ER signaling. The findings suggest that region-specific expression of ERα in the growth plates may contribute to the contrasting axial and appendicular bone growth phenotypes in ob/ob mice, and further research is needed to explore the association between ERs and leptin.",

    "conclusions": "Leptin deficiency in ob/ob mice results in contrasting phenotypes of axial and appendicular bone growth, characterized by reduced proliferative and hypertrophic markers in the femur growth plate and increased markers in the spinal growth plate. This is associated with region-specific expression of ERα, being lower in the femur and higher in the spine compared to wild-type mice. The study suggests that this region-specific ERα expression contributes to the contrasting growth patterns, and leptin deficiency impairs the regulatory effects of ER antagonists on longitudinal bone growth.",
