    "summary_full": "This study investigated the immunological and hematological effects of simulated spaceflight conditions (21 days of hindlimb unloading combined with low-dose gamma irradiation) in mice, assessed 7 days post-exposure. While immune cell differentials showed negligible changes, hematological analysis revealed significant alterations in red blood cell morphology and counts, suggesting anemia. Transcriptomic analysis of spleen cells indicated differential gene expression in pathways related to signal transduction, metabolism, cell cycle, chromatin organization, and DNA repair. Notably, gene expression profiles pointed towards persistent inflammation and dysregulated immune function, as well as pathways associated with human blood diseases. The findings suggest that recovery from simulated spaceflight is a prolonged process with lasting impacts on the immune and hematological systems.",

    "conclusions": "Seven days post-simulated spaceflight, mice exhibit significant hematological alterations, including signs of anemia, and altered splenic gene expression profiles indicative of persistent inflammation and dysregulated immune function. These findings highlight the complex and protracted nature of recovery from spaceflight conditions, suggesting a need for further investigation into countermeasures for maintaining astronaut health during long-duration missions.",
