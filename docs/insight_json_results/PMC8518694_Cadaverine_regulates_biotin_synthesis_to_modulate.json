    "document_title": "Cadaverine regulates biotin synthesis to modulate primary root growth in Arabidopsis",
    "summary_full": "This study investigates the molecular mechanisms by which cadaverine, a polyamine, affects primary root growth in Arabidopsis. Through a forward genetic screen, researchers identified a mutant, cdh3, exhibiting increased sensitivity to cadaverine. This mutation was found to affect the BIO3-BIO1 gene, which is involved in biotin biosynthesis. Exogenous supply of biotin and a pathway intermediate, 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid, suppressed the cdh3 phenotype. In vitro assays demonstrated that cadaverine directly inhibits the BIO3-BIO1 enzyme activity. Cadaverine treatment led to reduced biotinylation of Biotin Carboxyl Carrier Protein 1 (BCCP1), a component of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase complex, consequently decreasing triacylglyceride accumulation. These findings reveal a novel role for cadaverine in regulating biotin synthesis, thereby modulating plant primary root growth.",

    "conclusions": "Cadaverine inhibits primary root growth in Arabidopsis by directly inhibiting the BIO3-BIO1 enzyme, a key component of the biotin biosynthesis pathway. This inhibition leads to a reduction in biotinylation of BCCP1, impacting fatty acid synthesis and triacylglyceride accumulation. The study establishes a novel link between polyamine metabolism and essential vitamin biosynthesis, with implications for understanding plant growth regulation and resource allocation.",
