    "summary_full": "This study investigated the link between spaceflight-induced immune dysfunction and metabolic changes using female C57BL/6J mice flown on the Space Shuttle Atlantis (STS-135). The researchers analyzed spleen, adrenal glands, and liver tissues. They observed decreases in splenic leukocyte subsets but increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related activity. While corticosterone levels increased in adrenals and liver, catecholamine levels remained unchanged. Gene expression and metabolomic profiles suggested functional changes were not due to oxidative or psychological stress, but rather indicated increased fatty acid oxidation and decreased glycolysis. The findings propose a connection between spaceflight-induced immune and metabolic decrements.",

    "conclusions": "Spaceflight induces significant changes in both immune and metabolic functions. These changes are likely interconnected, with shifts in energy metabolism, particularly increased fatty acid oxidation and decreased glycolysis, potentially contributing to immune dysfunction. The findings suggest that spaceflight may alter cellular priorities, potentially increasing susceptibility to infection.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals a potential link between metabolic alterations and immune system dysfunction during spaceflight, highlighting the need for integrated approaches to astronaut health."
