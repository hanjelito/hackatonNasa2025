    "summary_full": "This study presents a microfluidic device with real-time imaging to characterize the modes of paralysis in Caenorhabditis elegans when exposed to four anthelmintic drugs: pyrantel, levamisole, tribendimidine, and methyridine. Unlike previous methods that relied on single-endpoint measurements, this approach quantifies multiple behavioral parameters over an extended period, including curls per second, types of paralysis, mode frequency, and the duration of active versus immobilized states. By exposing worms to equipotent concentrations (EC75) of each drug, the researchers observed distinct paralysis signatures for each compound. The findings highlight the importance of multi-parameter, time-resolved analysis for understanding drug effects, resistance, and adaptability in small animal models.",

    "conclusions": "A multi-parameter, time-resolved microfluidic assay can effectively differentiate the modes of paralysis induced by different anthelmintic drugs in C. elegans, revealing distinct behavioral signatures. This approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of drug efficacy and mechanism of action than single-endpoint assays, suggesting potential differences in receptor subtype targeting and overall potency among the tested drugs.",
