    "summary_full": "Particulate hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) is a known human lung carcinogen that induces chromosome instability, a key mechanism in its carcinogenic process. While homologous recombination (HR) repair protects against Cr(VI)-induced DNA damage, Cr(VI) has been shown to inhibit HR by misregulating RAD51, an essential protein for HR. Previous studies indicated that prolonged Cr(VI) exposure leads to RAD51 accumulation in the cytoplasm due to impaired nuclear import. This study investigated the impact of Cr(VI) on RAD51 nuclear import mediators, RAD51C and BRCA2. The findings show that acute (24h) Cr(VI) exposure does not affect the localization of RAD51C and BRCA2. However, prolonged (120h) exposure significantly increases the cytoplasmic localization of both proteins, with RAD51C being more severely affected. This correlates with the previously observed cytoplasmic accumulation of RAD51. Importantly, Cr(VI) does not inhibit the interaction between RAD51 and its import mediators, RAD51C and BRCA2. The study suggests that prolonged Cr(VI) exposure inhibits the nuclear import of RAD51C, and to a lesser extent BRCA2, leading to RAD51 cytoplasmic accumulation. This inhibition of nuclear import is proposed to be a critical factor in Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis, as nuclear import is vital for the function of many DNA repair and tumor suppressor proteins.",
