    "summary_full": "This review summarizes current knowledge on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in plants, focusing on its dynamics, architecture, interactions with other organelles, and its crucial role in stress adaptation. The ER is a dynamic network influenced by the actin cytoskeleton and myosin motor proteins, impacting its structure and communication with organelles like the Golgi, vacuoles, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. It is essential for synthesizing secreted proteins and maintaining protein homeostasis through quality control (ERQC) and ER-associated degradation (ERAD) mechanisms. Under stress conditions, the ER acts as a sensory organelle, initiating signaling pathways (like the unfolded protein response, UPR) to communicate with the nucleus and adapt. Some ER stress responses are conserved across eukaryotes, while others are plant-specific. The ER is also implicated in plant immunity, influencing the synthesis and signaling of immune receptors, and is exploited by viruses for pathogenesis. When ER stress overwhelms cellular capacity, programmed cell death (PCD) can be triggered. The review highlights the ER's multi-functionality in stress adaptation, emphasizing its relevance for sustainable crop production.",
