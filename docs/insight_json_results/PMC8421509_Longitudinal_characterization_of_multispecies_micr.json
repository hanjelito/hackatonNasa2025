    "document_title": "Longitudinal characterization of multispecies microbial populations recovered from spaceflight potable water",
    "summary_full": "This study investigates the phenotypic characteristics of microbial populations found in the International Space Station (ISS) potable water system over several years. Using archived isolates, researchers profiled antibiotic resistance, metabolism, hemolysis, and biofilm formation in both individual and mixed-species communities. The findings revealed a temporal dependence in microbial interactions, suggesting adaptation over time within the isolated ISS ecosystem. The study highlights the importance of functional characterization beyond sequencing for understanding microbial behavior in closed environments and has implications for microbial risk assessments in space and on Earth.",
    "key_findings": [
        "Microbial isolates from ISS potable water exhibited resistance to multiple drugs, often requiring combinations of antibiotics for complete elimination.",
        "Certain bacterial species, particularly Burkholderia, displayed hemolytic activity, posing a potential health risk to astronauts with compromised immune systems.",
        "Interspecies interactions were found to be temporally dependent, with species isolated in the same year showing positive relationships, while those from different years exhibited neutral relationships.",
        "Some ISS isolates demonstrated unstable phenotypes, including variations in hemolytic activity, colony morphology, and pigment production, which could pose challenges for detection and risk assessment.",
        "Biofilm formation was a common characteristic among ISS isolates, with distinct structural patterns and extracellular substance production observed.",
        "The study identified Ralstonia and Burkholderia as the predominant bacterial genera in the ISS potable water system between 2009 and 2016."
