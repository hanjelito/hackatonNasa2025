    "summary_full": "This study investigated the molecular effects of spaceflight on the mouse heart, hypothesizing that altered gene expression in stress response pathways contributes to cardiovascular deconditioning. Mice were exposed to 15 days of spaceflight, and their ventricular tissue was analyzed post-landing. Gene expression analysis revealed significant alterations in 37 out of 168 tested genes. Notably, spaceflight downregulated the oxidative stress regulator Nfe2l2 (Nrf2) while upregulating Nox1 and downregulating Ptgs2, suggesting increased oxidative stress. Furthermore, genes related to cell cycle regulation, such as Cdkn1a (p21) and Myc, were upregulated, while the inflammatory gene Tnf was downregulated. No changes were observed in apoptosis-related genes like Trp53. The findings indicate that spaceflight impacts redox balance, cell cycle, and senescence pathways in cardiac tissue, potentially contributing to cardiac dysfunction.",
