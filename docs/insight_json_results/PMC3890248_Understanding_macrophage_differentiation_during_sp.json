    "summary_full": "This study investigated the differentiation of mouse primary bone marrow cells into macrophages using two in vitro culture systems, the Techshot Cell Cult Bioreactor and the BioServe Fluid Processing Apparatus (FPA), in preparation for the STS-126 space flight. Experiments were conducted on Earth to assess the impact of device orientation and rotation on cell recovery and differentiation markers. Results showed that horizontal orientation and rotation (merry-go-round fashion) significantly improved macrophage recovery in both systems compared to vertical orientation or static conditions. Furthermore, the expression of differentiation markers like F4/80 varied between the FPA and bioreactor, indicating hardware-dependent outcomes. A subsequent space flight experiment on STS-126 using FPAs demonstrated that cells proliferated more in space and exhibited altered cell surface molecule expression and gene transcript levels compared to ground controls, particularly within the M-CSF/c-fms pathway. The study emphasizes the critical need to understand and validate culture systems and their orientations before interpreting space flight data.",

    "conclusions": "The outcomes of in vitro macrophage differentiation are highly dependent on the culture device and its orientation. Understanding these system-specific impacts is crucial for accurately interpreting data from space flight experiments. The findings from STS-126 confirm that space flight alters cellular processes, including proliferation and gene expression, underscoring the need for thorough pre-flight validation of experimental hardware and conditions.",
