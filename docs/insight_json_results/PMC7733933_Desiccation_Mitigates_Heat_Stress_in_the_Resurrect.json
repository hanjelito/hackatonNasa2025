    "summary_full": "This study investigates the impact of heat stress on the resurrection fern, Pleopeltis polypodioides, comparing hydrated and dehydrated fronds. Hydrated fronds were subjected to temperatures up to 50°C, while dehydrated fronds were exposed to temperatures up to 65°C for 24 hours. The research assessed morphological changes, photosystem II (PSII) efficiency, and metabolic indicators. Results showed that dehydrated fronds exhibited greater thermotolerance, with significant damage occurring above 55°C, whereas hydrated fronds showed damage above 35-40°C. Photosynthetic performance (measured by chlorophyll fluorescence and quantum yield) and metabolic activity (indicated by reducing capacity and antioxidant enzyme activity) were significantly reduced in hydrated fronds at lower temperatures compared to dehydrated fronds. Increased hydroperoxide and lipid hydroperoxide levels indicated oxidative stress, which was more pronounced in hydrated fronds beyond their thermal tolerance threshold. Fatty acid analysis revealed changes in composition and quantity, with higher unsaturation in dried fronds potentially contributing to heat tolerance. The study concludes that desiccation significantly enhances heat tolerance in P. polypodioides, highlighting the fern's remarkable adaptability to combined environmental stresses.",

    "conclusions": "Desiccation significantly enhances the thermotolerance of Pleopeltis polypodioides fronds, allowing them to withstand temperatures up to 55°C, whereas hydrated fronds are damaged above 40°C. This suggests that dehydration is a protective mechanism against heat damage in this species, illustrating its adaptability to combined environmental stresses.",
