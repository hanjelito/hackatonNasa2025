    "document_title": "Response of Arabidopsis thaliana and Mizuna Mustard Seeds to Simulated Space Radiation Exposures",
    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of simulated space radiation, specifically Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) and Solar Particle Event (SPE) protons, on dry and hydrated seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana and Mizuna mustard. Seeds were exposed to various radiation scenarios at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory, simulating conditions relevant to long-duration space missions. Following exposure, seeds were planted and grown into seedlings, and morphological parameters such as germination rate, viability, and root length were measured. The results indicated that hydrated seeds were more sensitive to radiation than dry seeds, and heavier ions generally caused more severe damage. While simulated GCR and SPE had less impact than high-LET particles, significant effects were observed, varying by seed type. Hydrated Arabidopsis seeds showed dose- and quality-dependent responses, with heavier ions leading to more defects. Dry Mizuna seeds exhibited increased cotyledon deformation after acute GCR2 exposure. The findings highlight the importance of considering seed type and hydration state when assessing radiation damage and suggest that further research is needed to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved and to identify radiation-resistant crops for space agriculture.",

    "conclusions": "Simulated GCR and SPE radiation have a demonstrable impact on Arabidopsis and Mizuna seeds, with effects varying based on dose, dose rate, radiation quality, and seed hydration state. Hydrated seeds are more sensitive, and heavier ions cause more severe damage. While these simulated exposures showed less damage than high-LET particles, significant effects were observed, underscoring the need for further research into the cellular and molecular mechanisms and the development of protective strategies for space agriculture.",
    "impact_statement": "This study provides crucial data on the effects of space radiation on plant seeds, informing the development of strategies for food production in long-duration space missions."
