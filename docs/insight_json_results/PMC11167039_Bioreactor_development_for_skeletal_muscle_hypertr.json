    "summary_full": "This study presents a proof-of-concept for a novel bioreactor system (StrexCell®) designed to simulate skeletal muscle hypertrophy and atrophy, relevant to spaceflight microgravity research. The bioreactor utilizes controlled uniaxial cyclic tensile strain to induce these changes in C2C12 myotubes. Applying cyclic stretch (0.75 Hz, 12% strain, 60 min/day) for 2 or 5 days led to significant myotube hypertrophy, evidenced by increased diameter and elevated anabolic markers like talin and phosphorylated Akt. Conversely, a 3-day cessation of cyclic stretch after 2 days of loading induced myotube atrophy, characterized by reduced myotube diameter, decreased Akt phosphorylation, and increased inflammatory and catabolic markers (IL-1ß, IL-6, NF-kappaB p65, and total FoxO3a). The findings suggest this bioreactor can effectively model the effects of increased loading (hypertrophy) and unloading (atrophy) on skeletal muscle cells, providing a valuable tool for studying spaceflight-induced muscle wasting and testing countermeasures.",
