    "document_title": "Conserved plant transcriptional responses to microgravity from two consecutive spaceflight experiments",
    "summary_full": "This study investigated the transcriptional responses of Arabidopsis thaliana shoots to microgravity using data from two separate spaceflight experiments, Plant Signaling (PS) and Plant RNA Regulation (PRR), conducted on the International Space Station. By comparing microgravity (Âµg) conditions to onboard 1g controls, the researchers identified significant overlap in differentially expressed genes between the two experiments. Genes involved in transcriptional regulation, shoot development, and responses to auxin and light were upregulated in microgravity. Conversely, genes related to defense response, abiotic stress, calcium signaling, and cell wall modification were downregulated. The study also identified three microRNAs (miRNAs) upregulated in microgravity, with their target genes showing downregulation, many of which are involved in chloroplast functions. The findings highlight conserved microgravity-specific transcriptional changes and underscore the importance of onboard 1g controls for distinguishing microgravity effects from other spaceflight stresses. The research also noted potential regulation by the transcription factor HY5 and altered expression of gravitropism-related genes.",

    "conclusions": "This study successfully identified conserved transcriptional responses to microgravity in Arabidopsis shoots across two independent spaceflight experiments. The findings highlight a distinct pattern of gene expression changes, with upregulation of growth-related genes and downregulation of stress responses, underscoring the unique effects of microgravity. The importance of onboard 1g controls for accurate interpretation of microgravity effects was strongly reinforced. The results provide a foundation for understanding plant adaptation to space and inform future research directions.",
