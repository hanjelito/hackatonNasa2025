    "summary_full": "This study investigates a novel method for culturing human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) to enhance their therapeutic potential by selectively proliferating highly functional subpopulations. The researchers combined microgravity conditions with stirred microspheres (polystyrene and collagen) to culture hASCs. After one week, this method significantly increased the proportion and number of SSEA-3-positive hASCs, which are considered highly functional. These cultured hASCs also exhibited higher expression of pluripotent markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, KLF), improved proliferation, colony formation, network formation (angiogenesis), and multilineage differentiation capabilities compared to cells cultured under normal conditions. The study suggests that this microgravity/microsphere culture technique can effectively expand these desirable stem cell populations, potentially improving regenerative therapies.",
