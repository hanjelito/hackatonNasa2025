    "summary_full": "This report details the preclinical development of TAK-754, an adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8)-based gene therapy vector designed for hemophilia A. The vector utilizes a codon-optimized and CpG-depleted B domain-deleted F8 transgene under a liver-specific promoter. In FVIII knockout mice, TAK-754 demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in plasma FVIII activity and a corresponding decrease in blood loss. Long-term, stable FVIII expression was observed in transgenic human FVIII mice. Toxicology and biodistribution studies in normal mice showed no adverse effects at doses up to 5.0 × 10^13 capsid particles/kg, with predominant vector DNA in the liver and minimal presence in other tissues. Integration site analysis revealed low vector integration with no signs of clonal outgrowth or preferred integration in oncogenes within the observation period. These findings support TAK-754's good safety and efficacy profile for hemophilia A gene therapy.",
