    "summary_full": "This study comprehensively profiles the immune system of the Inspiration4 crew using single-cell multi-omics, cell-free RNA, biochemical, and hematology data. It identifies a conserved \"spaceflight signature\" characterized by changes in oxidative phosphorylation, UV response, immune function, and TCF21 pathways, which was also observed in independent datasets including the NASA Twins Study and mouse models. Key findings include T cell up-regulation of FOXP3, long-term suppression of MHC class I genes, and associations between infection-related immune pathways and microbiome shifts. The research highlights conserved and distinct immune disruptions, details sex-specific responses with males appearing more affected, and suggests potential countermeasures. The data provides a valuable reference for future space missions and understanding spaceflight's impact on human health.",
