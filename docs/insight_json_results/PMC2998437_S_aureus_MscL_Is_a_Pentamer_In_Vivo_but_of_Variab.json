    "summary_full": "The bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is a crucial sensor of membrane tension, but its oligomeric state has been debated, with different crystal structures showing tetrameric and pentameric forms. This study investigates the in vivo oligomeric state of Staphylococcus aureus MscL (SaMscL). Using a disulfide-trapping approach in vivo, the researchers found that SaMscL predominantly exists as a pentamer in the bacterial cell membrane, indicating this is its physiologically relevant form. Further experiments with purified SaMscL revealed that while it forms pentamers in Triton X-100 and C8E5 detergents, it forms tetramers when solubilized in LDAO, the detergent used for its crystal structure determination. This detergent-induced stoichiometric shift was shown to be reversible. The findings highlight that detergents can alter membrane protein structures and emphasize the necessity of in vivo assays to determine the true functional oligomeric state of membrane proteins.",

    "conclusions": "The study definitively establishes that Staphylococcus aureus MscL (SaMscL) is a pentamer in vivo, which is its functional oligomeric state. It also demonstrates that detergents, specifically LDAO, can induce a reversible shift to a tetrameric stoichiometry in vitro, explaining discrepancies with previous crystallographic data. This highlights the critical need for in vivo validation to ascertain the true oligomeric state and function of membrane proteins, as in vitro solubilization conditions can lead to artifactual structural changes.",
    "impact_statement": "This research reveals that detergents can alter the structure of membrane proteins, emphasizing the importance of in vivo studies for understanding their true physiological function and potentially impacting the interpretation of structural data for numerous membrane protein studies."
