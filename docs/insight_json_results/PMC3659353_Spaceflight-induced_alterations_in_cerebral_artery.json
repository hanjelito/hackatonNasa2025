    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of 13 days of spaceflight on the cerebral arteries of mice. Contrary to the hypothesis that spaceflight would enhance vasoconstriction and increase medial wall thickness, the results showed reduced myogenic vasoconstriction, increased vascular distensibility, and greater maximal diameter in arteries from spaceflown mice compared to ground controls. Mechanical testing revealed lower stiffness and effective elastic modulus in the cerebral arteries of spaceflown mice. These findings suggest that spaceflight may lead to elevated cerebral blood flow, potentially contributing to increased intracranial pressure and visual impairments in astronauts. The study also highlighted differences between actual microgravity effects and those observed in ground-based simulations.",

    "conclusions": "Spaceflight significantly alters the functional, mechanical, and structural properties of mouse cerebral arteries, leading to reduced myogenic vasoconstriction, increased distensibility, and larger diameter. These changes suggest an elevation in cerebral blood flow during spaceflight, which could contribute to increased intracranial pressure and associated visual impairments in astronauts. The findings also indicate that ground-based simulations may not fully capture the cerebrovascular effects of actual microgravity.",
