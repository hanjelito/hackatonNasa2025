    "summary_full": "This study investigates how secondary metabolite diversity is generated in Aspergillus terreus. The researchers found that two distinct genes, atmelA and apvA, encode NRPS-like proteins that both produce the same precursor molecule, aspulvinone E. However, these genes are expressed in different fungal tissues: atmelA in conidia and apvA in hyphae. This spatial regulation directs aspulvinone E into two separate metabolic pathways. In conidia, aspulvinone E is converted into melanin, a brown pigment, with the help of the tyrosinase AtmelB. In hyphae, aspulvinone E is prenylated by the trans-prenyltransferase AbpB to form aspulvinones. Interestingly, AbpB also prenylates butyrolactones, demonstrating that tailoring enzymes can act on multiple substrates, further expanding metabolite diversity. Comparative genomics suggests atmelA and apvA may have a common ancestral gene. The study highlights a novel mechanism for generating metabolite diversity through tissue-specific expression of genes producing a common precursor, and through promiscuous tailoring enzymes.",

    "conclusions": "Metabolite diversity in fungi can be significantly expanded not only by having a large number of distinct biosynthetic gene clusters but also by employing spatial regulation of common precursors and by utilizing tailoring enzymes with broad substrate specificity. This study demonstrates that the tissue-specific expression of two genes (atmelA and apvA) producing the same precursor (aspulvinone E) leads to its diversion into different pathways, yielding distinct functional compounds. Furthermore, the promiscuity of the prenyltransferase AbpB in modifying different compound classes highlights another strategy for increasing metabolite diversity. These findings offer new insights into the complex mechanisms governing secondary metabolite production and suggest potential avenues for engineering biosynthetic pathways.",
