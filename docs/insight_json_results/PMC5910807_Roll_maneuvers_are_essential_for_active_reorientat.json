    "summary_full": "This study investigates the largely unexplored 3D locomotion of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The researchers identify and mathematically describe a unique \"roll maneuver,\" characterized by body torsion, which, in combination with 2D turns, allows C. elegans to reorient itself in three-dimensional space for effective exploration of its environment. While planar turns in swimming are less effective due to hydrodynamic hindrance, the roll maneuvers are significantly enhanced by hydrodynamic viscous forces, enabling rapid reorientation. The study develops a mathematical model incorporating curvature and torsion to describe these 3D movements, demonstrating its accuracy in reproducing observed burrowing and swimming behaviors. This work provides crucial insights into 3D neuromuscular actuation and offers a foundation for developing more sensitive locomotion assays.",

    "conclusions": "Roll maneuvers, characterized by body torsion, are a crucial and previously unrecognized behavioral pattern for Caenorhabditis elegans to actively reorient itself in 3D environments. These maneuvers, combined with 2D turns, enable comprehensive exploration of bulk media. Hydrodynamic forces play a dual role: hindering planar turns but significantly enhancing roll rotation rates in swimming. The developed mathematical model accurately describes these 3D movements, providing a powerful tool for future research into nematode neuromuscular actuation and behavior.",
