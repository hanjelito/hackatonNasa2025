    "summary_full": "This study investigates the roles of two Rab GTPase proteins, AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c, in Arabidopsis thaliana. While single mutants of these genes show no obvious defects, a double mutant (AtrabD2b/2c) exhibits shorter siliques, primarily due to defects in pollen development and pollen tube growth. The double mutant produces deformed pollen with swollen and branched pollen tube tips, and a significant portion of ovules remain unfertilized. Both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are highly expressed in pollen and localize to Golgi bodies, suggesting a partially redundant role in vesicle trafficking essential for pollen tube elongation. The findings indicate that these two Rab proteins are crucial for male gametophyte development and function, with their roles not being fully compensated by other AtRabD family members.",

    "conclusions": "AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are Golgi-resident proteins with partially redundant functions in vesicle trafficking that are essential for normal pollen development and pollen tube growth. Their overlapping roles are critical for male gametophyte function, and these functions are not fully compensated by other members of the AtRabD family.",
