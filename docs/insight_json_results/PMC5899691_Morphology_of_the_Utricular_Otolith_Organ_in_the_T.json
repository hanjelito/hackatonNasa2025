    "summary_full": "This study provides a detailed anatomical description of the utricle, a key component of the vestibular system responsible for sensing gravity and inertial acceleration, in the adult oyster toadfish (Opsanus tau). Using light, scanning, and transmission electron microscopy, the researchers visualized the sensory epithelium, its neural innervation, and synaptic organization. They identified a well-defined striola, distinct medial and lateral extra-striolar regions with zonal hair bundle organization, and a prominent lateral lacinia. Hair cell density varied across macular locations. Afferent nerve fibers showed narrow dendritic fields that followed hair bundle polarization, with synaptic specializations typically contacting a limited number of hair cells, though larger fields in the medial extra-striola contacted over 20 cells. Hair cell synaptic bodies could synapse onto individual afferents or multiple afferents. The study establishes a morphological basis for future functional studies on the toadfish's vestibular system, particularly in the context of altered gravitational environments.",

These findings establish a crucial baseline for understanding how this sensory organ functions and adapts, particularly in response to altered gravitational conditions relevant to space exploration. The observed variations in afferent complexity and synaptic organization suggest a highly structured system for processing gravito-inertial information.",
