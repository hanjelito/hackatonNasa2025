    "summary_full": "This study investigated the long-term molecular effects of unpredictable, variable prenatal stress (UVPS) on adult rat offspring. Researchers exposed pregnant rats to a daily regimen of unpredictable stressors and then examined DNA methylation of the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) gene and telomere length in the brains of their adult offspring. Findings revealed that male offspring exposed to prenatal stress exhibited increased Bdnf IV DNA methylation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) compared to non-stressed males and stressed females. Furthermore, prenatally stressed animals, regardless of sex, had shorter telomeres in the mPFC. These results suggest that maternal stress during gestation can lead to lasting changes in brain DNA methylation and telomere biology, with potential implications for behavioral and health outcomes in offspring.",

    "conclusions": "Intrauterine exposure to unpredictable, variable stress can induce lasting epigenetic (Bdnf IV DNA methylation) and telomeric (telomere length) changes in specific brain regions, particularly the medial prefrontal cortex, of adult rat offspring. These changes are sex-specific in terms of methylation patterns and highlight the profound impact of early-life stress on brain development and potential long-term health outcomes.",
    "impact_statement": "This study provides evidence for molecular mechanisms by which prenatal stress can program long-term changes in the offspring's brain, offering insights into the developmental origins of stress-related disorders."
