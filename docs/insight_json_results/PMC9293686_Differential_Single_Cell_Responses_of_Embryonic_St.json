    "document_title": "Differential Single Cell Responses of Embryonic Stem Cells Versus Embryoid Bodies to Gravity Mechanostimulation",
    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of a short pulse of hypergravity (HG) on mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and embryoid bodies (EBs) using single-cell RNA sequencing. While a 60-minute HG pulse (50 g / 5 kPa) induced limited transcriptome shifts in ESCs, it caused more pronounced positional shifts in EB mapping, suggesting greater mechanotransduction sensitivity in committed cells. In ESCs, HG upregulated self-renewal and angiogenesis genes. In EBs, HG was associated with increased Gene Ontology pathways for multicellular development, mechanical signal transduction, and DNA damage repair. HG also promoted the maintenance of transitory cell phenotypes in EBs, leading to co-expression of markers for progenitor, post-implant epiblast, and primitive endoderm. Pseudotime analysis identified three cell types susceptible to HG-induced fate decisions. The findings indicate that gravity mechanostimulation can regulate ESC maintenance and EB development, with committed stem cells being more sensitive to gravity-induced transcriptomic changes.",
