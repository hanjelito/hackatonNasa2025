    "summary_full": "This study validates the WetLab-2 system, a novel suite of molecular biology tools designed for on-orbit gene expression analysis on the International Space Station (ISS). The system includes an RNA Sample Preparation Module, fluid transfer devices, lyophilized PCR assays, a centrifuge, and a real-time PCR thermal cycler. Experiments were conducted in microgravity to test quantitative PCR (qPCR) on DNA standards and reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) on RNA extracted from E. coli and mouse liver tissue. Results showed that on-orbit qPCR efficiencies and cycle threshold (Ct) values were comparable to Earth-based controls. Multiplex gene expression analysis was successfully performed within approximately 3 hours. A challenge encountered was gas bubble formation in assay tubes during thermal cycling, which increased Ct curve noise. This issue was successfully mitigated in a follow-up experiment using standard caps to pressurize the tubes. The WetLab-2 system demonstrates the feasibility of complex wet bench experiments in space, providing a new capability for on-orbit molecular biology research.",
