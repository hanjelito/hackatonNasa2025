    "summary_full": "This review examines the biological and functional outcomes of spaceflight hazards, specifically microgravity and radiation, using ground-based rodent models. It highlights the combined effects of radiation and reduced weight-bearing (simulated by hind limb unloading and partial weight-bearing) on skeletal, ocular, central nervous system (CNS), cardiovascular, and stem cell responses. The paper discusses the limitations of current ground-based models, particularly hind limb unloading, and emphasizes the necessity of studying combined hazards for accurate risk assessment and countermeasure development for long-duration space missions beyond low Earth orbit.",

    "conclusions": "Astronauts undertaking long-duration missions beyond low Earth orbit will face simultaneous exposure to microgravity and space radiation. Current research predominantly focuses on individual hazards, necessitating a shift towards combined hazard studies. Ground-based models, particularly rodent hind limb unloading (HLU) and partial weight-bearing (PWB), are essential for this research, but have limitations that must be considered. Understanding the additive or synergistic effects of these stressors on skeletal, ocular, CNS, cardiovascular, and stem cell systems is crucial for accurate risk assessment and the development of effective countermeasures to ensure astronaut health and mission success.",
