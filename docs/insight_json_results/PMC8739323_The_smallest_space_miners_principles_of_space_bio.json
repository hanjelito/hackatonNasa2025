    "summary_full": "This review explores the principles and feasibility of space biomining for in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) in the Moon, Mars, and asteroids. It highlights the potential of microbial-based biotechnologies to extract essential resources like metals, nutrients, water, and oxygen from extraterrestrial regolith and rocks. While terrestrial biomining techniques are established, direct application to space is challenging due to differences in environmental conditions (gravity, radiation, atmosphere, temperature) and rock composition. The paper discusses the need for research into organotrophic, cyanobacteria, and community-based bioleaching mechanisms, as well as anaerobic biomining and the use of synthetic biology to overcome space-specific limitations. It also considers the integration of biomining with biological life support systems (BLSS) and its potential for bioremediation and waste recycling. The review concludes that while the science is young, investing in research is crucial for developing sustainable space exploration and settlement.",

    "conclusions": "Space biomining holds significant potential for ISRU and sustainable extraterrestrial settlements, offering economic and environmental advantages. However, direct application of terrestrial methods is limited by unique space conditions and resource availability. Future research must focus on understanding space effects on biomining, exploring diverse microbial mechanisms (organotrophic, cyanobacteria, anaerobic), and leveraging synthetic biology to overcome challenges. Integration with life support systems and consideration of planetary protection are also crucial.",
