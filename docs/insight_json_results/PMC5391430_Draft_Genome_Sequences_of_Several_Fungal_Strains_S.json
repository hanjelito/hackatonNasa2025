    "document_title": "Draft Genome Sequences of Several Fungal Strains Selected for Exposure to Microgravity at the International Space Station",
    "summary_full": "This paper presents the draft whole-genome sequences of eight fungal strains chosen for exposure to microgravity on the International Space Station (ISS). These strains were isolated from environments associated with the Chernobyl nuclear power plant or soil and are known for producing valuable natural products, possessing secondary metabolism pathways, or exhibiting radiotropism. The selected fungi include Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus terreus, Aureobasidium pullulans, Beauveria bassiana, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Cladosporium sphaerospermum, Fusarium solani, and Trichoderma virens. Their genomes were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform and assembled using the MaSuRCA genome assembler. These baseline genomic sequences are intended to facilitate future research into the production of novel bioactive compounds by these fungi under microgravity conditions.",
