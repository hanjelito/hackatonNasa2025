    "summary_full": "The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) acts as a biological emergency release valve in bacteria, opening under osmotic downshock to release cytoplasmic solutes. Its properties make it suitable for triggered nanovalves in drug-release devices. Previous work showed that introducing charges into the MscL pore can gate the channel without membrane tension, enabling the engineering of nanoswitches responsive to stimuli like light or pH. This study investigates how pore charges affect the permeation of charged compounds. Using in vivo efflux assays and electrophysiological approaches, the researchers demonstrated that introducing charges into the MscL pore lumen influences the permeation of charged molecules. These effects were more pronounced for larger compounds and surprisingly dependent on the orientation of the MscL channel in the membrane. The findings have implications for the efficiency of drug-release devices.",

    "conclusions": "Charges introduced into the MscL pore lumen, either through mutation or post-translational modification, can significantly alter the channel's ionic preference and drastically influence the permeation of large charged compounds. This influence is dependent on the nature of the charge, the size and charge of the permeating molecule, and the orientation of the MscL channel within the membrane. These findings are crucial for the rational design of MscL-based nanovalves for targeted drug delivery.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals how manipulating charges within the MscL channel pore can control the passage of charged molecules, providing critical insights for developing more efficient and targeted nanovalve systems for drug delivery."
