    "summary_full": "This review proposes that chronic sub-optimal hydration in the weeks preceding COVID-19 infection may significantly increase the risk of mortality. The authors present evidence linking sub-optimal hydration (characterized by hypertonicity, total body water deficit, and/or hypovolemia) to established risk factors for COVID-19 death, such as older age, male sex, certain race-ethnicities, and chronic diseases. They hypothesize that these hydration states can lead to physiological adaptations that promote increased ACE2 receptor abundance in the lungs, pre-set lung epithelial cells for exaggerated immune responses, enhance capillary leakage into the airways, and reduce the capacity for fluid removal from the airways. These mechanisms, acting in concert, could explain the increased severity and mortality observed in certain COVID-19 patients. The paper suggests that public health strategies should consider increasing water intake, implementing hydration screening alongside COVID-19 testing, and tailoring treatments based on an individual's pre-infection hydration status. Addressing hydration could simultaneously mitigate multiple pathways contributing to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.",

    "conclusions": "The authors conclude that chronic sub-optimal hydration in the weeks before COVID-19 infection is a plausible, unifying mechanism that increases the risk of severe disease and mortality. This hypothesis is supported by evidence linking hydration status to key risk factors and proposed physiological pathways that promote lung fluid accumulation. They advocate for hydration-focused interventions, including public health recommendations for increased water intake, hydration screening, and tailored clinical treatments, as potential strategies to reduce COVID-19 mortality and health disparities.",
    "impact_statement": "This paper proposes that optimizing hydration could be a simple, accessible, and multi-faceted strategy to reduce COVID-19 mortality by mitigating several key pathological pathways simultaneously."
