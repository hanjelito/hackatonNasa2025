    "document_title": "Inter-agency perspective: Translating advances in biomarker discovery and medical countermeasures development between terrestrial and space radiation environments",
    "summary_full": "This paper discusses the collaborative efforts between the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to develop medical countermeasures (MCMs) and biomarkers for radiation-induced biological effects. These agencies share overlapping research interests due to the need to protect cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy, civilian populations from radiological incidents, and astronauts from space radiation. The article highlights the synergies in research funding, shared expertise, and the development of preclinical models and data analysis tools. It reviews various classes of potential MCMs, including antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, anti-apoptotics, senotherapeutics, statins, ACE inhibitors, and antibiotics, many of which are already licensed or in development for terrestrial applications. The paper also touches upon regulatory considerations for product approval by the FDA and NASA's unique pathway for MCMs in spaceflight. The conclusion emphasizes the importance of continued inter-agency collaboration to leverage research investments and accelerate the development of countermeasures for diverse human populations exposed to radiation.",
