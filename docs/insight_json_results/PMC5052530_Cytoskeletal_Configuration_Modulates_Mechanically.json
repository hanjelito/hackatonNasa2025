    "summary_full": "This study investigates how low-intensity vibrations (LIV) affect human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs), focusing on the role of cytoskeletal configuration. Researchers applied LIV horizontally (in-plane) and vertically (out-of-plane) to hBMSCs cultured in 2D. They found that all LIV signals enhanced hBMSC proliferation, osteogenic differentiation, and upregulated genes related to cytoskeletal structure. The cellular response was more pronounced with horizontal LIV, leading to cytoskeleton realignment and increased cell stiffness. Higher frequencies (100 Hz vs. 30 Hz) also amplified the response. The study concludes that the orientation of mechanical signals relative to the cell's attachment plane is crucial for sensing and responding to LIV, suggesting that intracellular cytoskeletal configuration plays a key role in this process.",

    "conclusions": "The direction of low-intensity vibration (LIV) relative to the cell's attachment plane significantly modulates mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) responses. Horizontal LIV, applied in-plane, is more effective than vertical LIV in promoting osteogenesis, cytoskeletal remodeling, and increasing cell stiffness. This suggests that the cell's cytoskeletal configuration is critical for sensing and responding to high-frequency, low-intensity mechanical signals, likely through mechanisms involving the nucleus and its connections to the cytoskeleton.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals that the orientation of mechanical stimulation is crucial for directing stem cell differentiation and function, offering insights for developing targeted therapies for bone regeneration and musculoskeletal health."
