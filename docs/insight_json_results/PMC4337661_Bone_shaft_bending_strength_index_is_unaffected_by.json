    "document_title": "Bone shaft bending strength index is unaffected by exercise and unloading in mice",
    "summary_full": "This study investigated whether physical activity levels causally affect the bone shaft bending strength index (Imax/Imin), a measure used in anthropology to infer past human activity. Two experiments were conducted on mice: one simulating high activity through treadmill exercise and another simulating low activity through hindlimb unloading. While exercise significantly increased both Imax and Imin, it did not significantly alter the Imax/Imin ratio. Similarly, unloading led to decreased Imax and Imin compared to controls, but did not significantly decrease the Imax/Imin ratio. These findings suggest that the bone shaft bending strength index may not be a reliable indicator of physical activity levels, cautioning against its use in reconstructing past human behavior.",

    "conclusions": "The study concludes that the bone shaft bending strength index (Imax/Imin) is not significantly altered by simulated high or low activity levels in mice. This suggests that caution is needed when using this index to reconstruct the physical activity levels of past humans, as it may not be a reliable indicator of lifestyle.",
    "impact_statement": "This research challenges the long-held assumption that bone shaft shape directly reflects physical activity levels, potentially impacting anthropological interpretations of past human behavior and skeletal remains."
