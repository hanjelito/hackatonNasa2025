    "summary_full": "This study investigated the molecular responses of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings to spaceflight using a combined proteomic and transcriptomic approach. Seedlings grown on the International Space Station were compared to ground controls to identify differential expression of RNAs and proteins, as well as post-translational modifications. The results revealed significant impacts on post-transcriptional regulation, cell wall synthesis, redox homeostasis, microtubule dynamics, and plastid gene transcription. Notably, there was a low correlation between transcript and protein level changes, highlighting the importance of post-transcriptional and post-translational regulatory mechanisms in adapting to microgravity. Key findings include alterations in RNA decapping, splicing factors, and translation initiation, as well as changes in cell wall components like AHA2 and CESA1, and tubulin phosphorylation. The study also observed dysregulation of plastid gene transcription, which may represent a wasteful response to the absence of gravity. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of plant responses to spaceflight and suggest potential targets for engineering plants for improved growth in microgravity.",
