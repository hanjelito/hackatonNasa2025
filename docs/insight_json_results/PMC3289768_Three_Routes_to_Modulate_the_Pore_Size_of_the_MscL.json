    "summary_full": "The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) protects bacterial cells from lysis by opening in response to osmotic downshock. It is a well-characterized mechanosensor with potential applications as a triggered nanovalve in biosensors and drug-release devices. This study investigates the structure and function of the MscL channel, particularly the cytoplasmic bundle (CB) formed by the carboxyl-terminal α-helices. The researchers demonstrate that the CB does not need to dissociate for normal channel gating. They also show that the channel's conductance can be modulated by altering the linker between the transmembrane domain 2 (TM2) and the CB. Three methods were explored: shortening the linker through deletions, constraining it via disulfide crosslinking of introduced cysteine residues, or by coordinating engineered histidine residues with heavy metals. All three methods successfully reduced channel conductance, with crosslinking and heavy metal coordination offering reversible modulation. These findings provide new strategies for engineering MscL-based nanodevices with tunable pore sizes and functionalities.",

    "conclusions": "The cytoplasmic bundle (CB) of the MscL channel is stable and does not dissociate during normal gating. The conductance of the MscL channel can be effectively and reversibly modulated by altering the TM2/CB linker through deletions, disulfide crosslinking, or heavy metal coordination. These modifications provide versatile routes for engineering MscL-based nanovalves with tunable pore sizes for various nanotechnological applications.",
