    "summary_full": "This study investigated the proteomic and secretomic responses of the black fungus Knufia chersonesos (wild type and a melanin-deficient mutant) to simulated microgravity (LSSMG) using high-aspect-ratio vessels. Proteomic analysis revealed differential expression of proteins involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, transport, and ribosome biogenesis. Notably, no significant activation of stress components or starvation response was detected, except for scytalone dehydratase, which showed opposite regulation in the wild type and mutant. While morphological changes and survivability were not significantly affected by LSSMG, differences in protein modulation were observed between the wild type and mutant strains, suggesting that cell-wall melanization may influence the metabolic response to microgravity. This research provides insights into the adaptability of black fungi to space conditions and has implications for astrobiology.",

    "conclusions": "Knufia chersonesos exhibits a notable ability to cope with simulated microgravity conditions, with distinct proteomic and secretomic responses observed between the wild-type and melanin-deficient mutant strains. The absence of significant stress activation suggests an energy-saving strategy, while the observed protein modulations indicate potential adaptations in metabolism and transport. Cell-wall melanization appears to play a role in modulating the fungal response to microgravity, highlighting its importance for astrobiological applications.",
