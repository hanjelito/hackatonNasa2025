    "summary_full": "This study investigated the impact of spaceflight on the salivary microbiome of 10 astronauts and its potential link to viral reactivation. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and qPCR, researchers analyzed saliva samples collected pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight. Results showed a decrease in overall salivary microbiome diversity during spaceflight, with specific changes in the abundance of certain bacterial phyla and genera. Notably, some genera like Catonella, Megasphera, and Actinobacillus, absent pre-flight, were detected during flight. Correlations were found between specific bacterial groups and viral titers, particularly for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), with higher microbiome richness correlating with increased EBV load. Certain bacteria, such as Gracilibacteria and Abiotrophia, were positively correlated with viral reactivation, while others like Oribacterium and Haemophilus showed inverse correlations, suggesting a potential protective role. The study highlights the dynamic nature of the astronaut salivary microbiome during spaceflight and identifies potential bacterial biomarkers for viral reactivation, which could inform strategies to maintain astronaut health on long-duration missions.",
