    "document_title": "Spatial Characterization of Microbial Communities on Multi-Species Leafy Greens Grown Simultaneously in the Vegetable Production Systems on the International Space Station",
    "summary_full": "This study investigated the microbial communities on leafy greens (red romaine lettuce, mizuna mustard, and green leaf lettuce) grown in the Veggie system on the International Space Station (ISS). Using both culture-based and molecular methods, researchers characterized bacteria and fungi on plant leaves, roots, pillow components, and Veggie chamber surfaces across three technology demonstrations (VEG-03D, E, and F). Culture-based screening confirmed the leafy greens were safe for consumption, with low counts of bacteria and fungi on surfaces. Molecular analysis revealed higher microbial diversity in roots and substrate compared to leaves and wicks. The study found that while plant type had a minor influence, the experimental run (tech demo) and sample location within the Veggie system significantly impacted microbial community composition. Dominant genera like Burkholderia and Pseudomonas were identified across various samples, with some genera potentially originating from ISS water sources. The findings provide crucial data for understanding plant microbiomes in closed environments and ensuring food safety for long-duration space missions.",

    "conclusions": "The study successfully characterized the microbial communities associated with multi-species leafy greens grown in the ISS Veggie system, confirming the safety of the crops for consumption. While plant type had a limited effect, the location within the Veggie system and the specific experimental run influenced microbial composition. The presence of common ISS microbes in the Veggie system highlights potential sources of contamination and the need for continued monitoring and management strategies for sustainable space agriculture.",
    "impact_statement": "This research provides critical insights into the plant microbiome within space-based agricultural systems, informing the development of safe and sustainable food production for future long-duration space missions."
