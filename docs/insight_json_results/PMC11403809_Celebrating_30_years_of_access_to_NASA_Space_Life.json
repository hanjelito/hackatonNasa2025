    "document_title": "Celebrating 30 years of access to NASA Space Life Sciences data",
    "summary_full": "This paper commemorates significant anniversaries in NASA's space life sciences data archiving: 30 years of the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive (ALSDA) and 10 years of NASA GeneLab. These archives are crucial for understanding the effects of space travel on biological systems and mitigating risks for future missions like Moon to Mars. ALSDA, established in 1994, initially focused on collecting diverse life sciences data, including experimental results, telemetry, and bioimaging, and played a role in developing the OAIS standard. GeneLab, initiated in 2014, specializes in omics data (genomics, proteomics, etc.) and has developed standardized bioinformatics pipelines and visualization tools. In 2021, ALSDA and GeneLab merged to form the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR), creating a unified platform for accessing both legacy and omics data. OSDR now hosts over 500 studies across various life forms and is expanding its capabilities with AI/machine learning integration and collaborations with international space agencies, embodying NASA's commitment to open science.",
