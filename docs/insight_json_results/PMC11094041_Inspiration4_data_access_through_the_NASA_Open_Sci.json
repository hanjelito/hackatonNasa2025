    "summary_full": "This article provides a guide on accessing and analyzing data from the SpaceX Inspiration4 (I4) mission, which is available through the NASA Open Science Data Repository (OSDR). The I4 mission collected extensive omics and clinical data from four civilian astronauts, offering a unique opportunity for multi-modal, longitudinal assessments of spaceflight's impact on human physiology. The OSDR ensures transparent and FAIR access to these data, which are crucial for understanding space-induced biological responses and guiding future mission planning and health risk mitigation. The article details how to access metadata and data programmatically via GLOpenAPI, including examples for differential expression analysis. It highlights the importance of standardized data formats and community-driven standards for enabling AI/ML applications and establishes a precedent for post-mission health monitoring programs in space agencies.",
