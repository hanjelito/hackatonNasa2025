    "summary_full": "This study investigated the viability and diversity of microbial communities in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms using propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment coupled with pyrosequencing and PhyloChip DNA microarray analyses. PMA treatment selectively targets DNA from viable cells by preventing amplification of DNA from dead cells. Results showed that untreated samples yielded a high abundance of diverse bacterial sequences, while PMA-treated samples yielded significantly fewer sequences, primarily from a few robust bacterial lineages. PhyloChip analyses corroborated these findings. The study found that cleanrooms housing spacecraft hardware had a less diverse viable bacterial population, dominated by hardy organisms, compared to cleanrooms without hardware. This research represents the first comprehensive effort to assess cell viability in low-biomass environmental samples and correlate it with phylogenetic affiliation, highlighting the overestimation of microbial populations when viability is not considered.",

    "conclusions": "The study successfully demonstrated that PMA treatment, when combined with high-throughput sequencing and microarray technologies, can effectively differentiate between viable and non-viable microbial cells in low-biomass cleanroom environments. This approach revealed that the viable microbial communities in spacecraft assembly cleanrooms are less diverse than previously estimated, and are often dominated by hardy, spore-forming bacteria. The findings underscore the importance of viability assessment for accurate microbial profiling and have significant implications for planetary protection protocols and industrial cleanroom management.",
    "impact_statement": "This research provides a crucial method for accurately assessing viable microbial contamination in sensitive environments like spacecraft assembly facilities, thereby improving the reliability of space exploration missions and industrial quality control."
