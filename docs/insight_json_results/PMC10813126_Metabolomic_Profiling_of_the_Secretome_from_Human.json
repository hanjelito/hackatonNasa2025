    "summary_full": "This study investigated the metabolic changes in human neural stem cells (NSCs) exposed to microgravity (ÂµG) during a spaceflight to the International Space Station (ISS). After 3 days in space, the secretome of NSCs revealed increased glycolysis, evidenced by elevated pyruvate and glycerate levels. The cells also showed activated catabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and glutamine, suggesting increased energy demands. Furthermore, space-flown NSCs (SPC-NSCs) exhibited enhanced NADH synthesis and spermidine production compared to ground controls (GC-NSCs). These findings indicate that the space environment triggers adaptive responses in NSCs, primarily by increasing energy production through enhanced glycolysis and amino acid catabolism to meet the demands of microgravity.",

    "conclusions": "Microgravity induces a significant stress response in human neural stem cells, leading to increased energy production through enhanced glycolysis and amino acid catabolism. The observed increase in NADH synthesis and spermidine production suggests adaptive mechanisms to cope with the space environment. These findings have implications for maintaining CNS homeostasis during long-duration space missions and highlight the need for further research into NSC behavior in space.",
