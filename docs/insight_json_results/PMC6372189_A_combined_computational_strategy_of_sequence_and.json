    "summary_full": "This study challenges the prevailing view that insects lack eicosanoid biosynthesis pathways by employing advanced bioinformatics and structural modeling to identify putative fly homologs of mammalian eicosanoid synthesis enzymes. Despite low global sequence identities, 20 Drosophila candidate enzymes were selected based on sequence similarity, domain architecture, and conservation of functional residues. Structural models revealed significant conservation in folds and functional residues for most candidates. While lipoxygenase enzymes could not be identified, structural homology models for three fly cyclooxygenases were generated. The findings predict that Drosophila melanogaster likely possesses one or more pathways for eicosanoid or eicosanoid-like biolipid synthesis, suggesting that eicosanoid mediators regulate biological functions in insects. This opens avenues for experimental validation using Drosophila genetics, with potential relevance to human health.",

    "conclusions": "The study concludes that Drosophila melanogaster likely possesses a functional eicosanoid synthesis pathway, with identified candidate enzymes showing significant structural and functional residue conservation compared to their mammalian counterparts. Despite the absence of clear lipoxygenase homologs, the presence of other pathway components suggests a potentially non-canonical eicosanoid system in insects. These findings necessitate experimental validation and open up Drosophila as a model organism for studying eicosanoid biology.",
