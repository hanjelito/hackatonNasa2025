    "summary_full": "This study investigated the early signaling events in Arabidopsis seedlings responding to heat stress. Using 2-D difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, 19 microsomal proteins with altered expression levels within 5 minutes of heat treatment were identified. Among these, annexin 1 (AtANN1) was found to be rapidly upregulated. Functional studies using loss-of-function mutants (ann1/ann2 double mutants) showed increased sensitivity to heat shock, while overexpression of AtANN1 conferred resistance. The heat-induced expression of heat-shock proteins and factors was inhibited in the ann1/ann2 mutant, and the heat-activated increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) was significantly impaired. These findings suggest AtANN1 plays a crucial role in regulating heat-induced calcium increases and mediating the plant's response to heat stress.",

    "conclusions": "Arabidopsis Annexin 1 (AtANN1) is a key mediator of heat stress responses, primarily by regulating the heat-induced increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]cyt). AtANN1 and its homolog AtANN2 play redundant roles in this process, with loss-of-function mutants showing impaired thermotolerance and reduced expression of heat shock response genes. Overexpression of AtANN1 enhances thermotolerance. These findings establish annexins as significant components of the machinery involved in heat-induced calcium signaling in plants.",
    "impact_statement": "This study identifies a critical role for Arabidopsis Annexin 1 in plant thermotolerance by elucidating its function in mediating heat-induced calcium signaling, providing a new target for improving crop resilience to heat stress."
