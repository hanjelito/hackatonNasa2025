    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of whole-body high-energy proton irradiation on mouse retinas and optic nerve heads (ONH), comparing single and fractionated doses. Mice received either a single 0.5 Gy dose or 12 fractions totaling 0.5 Gy over 25 days. Four months post-irradiation, significant increases in apoptotic cells were observed in both retina and ONH for both exposure types, with more pronounced changes in the ONH for fractionated doses. Oxidative stress, indicated by 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) immunoreactivity, was elevated in both regions, with a single dose showing more pronounced effects in the retina and ONH. Blood-retina barrier (BRB) integrity was assessed using biomarkers AQP-4, ZO-1, and PECAM-1. The retina showed increased AQP-4 and PECAM-1 expression and decreased ZO-1 expression, indicating BRB disruption, particularly after a single dose. The ONH region exhibited limited AQP-4 and ZO-1 immunoreactivity, suggesting different BRB properties compared to the retina. The findings suggest that proton radiation induces oxidative stress-associated apoptosis and BRB changes in the retina, with differential responses between single and fractionated doses and distinct regional characteristics between the retina and ONH.",

The study highlights differences in BRB biomarker distribution between the retina and ONH, and suggests that cellular responses to radiation may be differentially regulated by acute versus fractionated dose schedules.",
