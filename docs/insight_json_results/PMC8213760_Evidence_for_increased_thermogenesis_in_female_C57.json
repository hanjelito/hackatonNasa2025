    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of spaceflight on thermogenesis in female C57BL/6J mice. Mice were housed on the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days, and their carcasses were returned to Earth for analysis. Gene expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) was examined. Results showed increased non-shivering thermogenesis in BAT and increased glucose uptake, metabolism, adipogenesis, and beta-oxidation in WAT. These findings suggest that spaceflight induces adaptive thermogenesis, which could confound results in spaceflight studies and impact the translatability of animal models to astronauts due to species-specific differences in thermoregulation.",
    "key_findings": [
        "Spaceflight for 37 days increased non-shivering thermogenesis in the brown adipose tissue (BAT) of female C57BL/6J mice, evidenced by a 1.5-fold increase in Ucp-1 gene expression.",
        "White adipose tissue (WAT) showed differential gene expression consistent with increased glucose uptake and metabolism, adipogenesis, and beta-oxidation.",
        "Activity levels, food, and water consumption were higher in spaceflight animals compared to ground controls, supporting increased adaptive thermogenesis.",
        "The housing temperatures on the ISS (average 26.0-26.4 Â°C) were below thermoneutral for mice, likely contributing to the observed thermogenic adaptations."

This heightened thermogenesis may confound spaceflight studies and has implications for the translatability of animal models to astronauts.",
