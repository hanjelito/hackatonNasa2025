    "summary_full": "This study profiled the plasma proteins, metabolites, and extracellular vesicles/particles (EVPs) of the SpaceX Inspiration4 crew to understand the physiological responses to short-duration spaceflight. The \"spaceflight secretome profiles\" revealed significant alterations in coagulation, oxidative stress, and brain-enriched proteins. While most changes in EVPs and metabolites resolved within six months, a majority of plasma protein changes persisted. Immune cells, particularly lymphoid cells, were identified as a significant contributor to these secretome alterations. The study also investigated potential mechanisms for brain-enriched protein detection and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, observing increased PECAM-1 in spaceflight mice brains, a marker of BBB integrity. These findings highlight the impact of even short spaceflights on human and murine physiology and identify potential biomarkers for monitoring crew health and developing countermeasures.",

    "conclusions": "Short-duration spaceflight significantly alters the human secretome, impacting coagulation, oxidative stress, and brain homeostasis. While many changes are transient, persistent alterations in plasma proteins highlight the need for continued monitoring. The findings suggest potential blood-brain barrier disruption and identify key protein and metabolite changes that can serve as biomarkers for crew health and countermeasure development.",
