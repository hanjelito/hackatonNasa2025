    "summary_full": "This study investigated the short-term effects of simulated microgravity on human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) using a lab-on-chip clinostat system, varying the clinorotation speed (0, 30, 60, and 75 rpm) over 8 hours. Results showed that higher angular frequencies led to greater inhibition of cell spreading and more rounded morphologies. While cells at 30 rpm showed similar average areas to controls after 8 hours, cells at 75 rpm maintained viability and could re-spread post-clinorotation. In migration experiments, clinorotation did not alter migration patterns in elongated cells but caused cell retraction, significantly compromising motility. The findings suggest that the rate of gravity vector perturbation influences a cell's ability to sense and respond to simulated microgravity, impacting morphology and motility.",

    "conclusions": "Human mesenchymal stem cells respond to clinorotation by adopting more rounded, less-spread morphologies in an angular frequency-dependent manner, suggesting that the rate of perturbation influences cellular gravisensing. Simulated microgravity significantly compromises hMSC motility by inducing cell retraction, indicating that the cellular response to microgravity dominates over chemotactic signals. These findings have implications for understanding stem cell behavior in space and for stem cell-based applications.",
