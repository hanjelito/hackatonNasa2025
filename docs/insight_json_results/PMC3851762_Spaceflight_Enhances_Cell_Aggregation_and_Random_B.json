    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of spaceflight on the human opportunistic fungal pathogen, Candida albicans, using transcriptional profiling and phenotypic characterization. C. albicans grown in spaceflight conditions showed differential regulation of 452 genes compared to ground controls. Phenotypically, spaceflight-cultured cells exhibited enhanced cell aggregation and random budding, contrasting with the bipolar budding observed in ground samples. Gene expression analysis revealed upregulation of genes involved in cell aggregation (similar to flocculation) and random budding, as well as genes related to antifungal and stress resistance (e.g., ABC transporters, oxidative stress resistance genes). Conversely, genes involved in ergosterol synthesis and the actin cytoskeleton were downregulated. The transcriptional regulator Cap1 and a significant portion of its regulon were differentially expressed, suggesting a role in the spaceflight response. Despite these changes, which could indicate a virulence-related phenotype, no increased virulence was observed in a murine infection model under the study's conditions. The findings provide a basis for assessing the risk of commensal flora during spaceflight and may offer insights into novel infectious disease mechanisms.",

    "conclusions": "Spaceflight culture conditions significantly alter the gene expression profile of Candida albicans, leading to phenotypic changes such as enhanced cell aggregation and random budding. These changes are associated with differential regulation of genes involved in stress resistance, antifungal resistance, and cell morphology. While these alterations suggest a potential for increased virulence, this was not observed in the tested murine model. The study highlights the importance of understanding microbial responses to spaceflight for assessing risks to astronaut health and provides a foundation for future research into the mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis.",
