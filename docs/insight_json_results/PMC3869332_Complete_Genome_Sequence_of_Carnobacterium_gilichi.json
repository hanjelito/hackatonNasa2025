    "summary_full": "This paper reports the complete genome sequence of Carnobacterium gilichinskyi strain WN1359, isolated from Siberian permafrost. This strain is notable for its ability to grow under simulated Martian conditions, including cold temperatures (0Â°C), low pressure (0.7-kPa), and a CO2-dominated anoxic atmosphere. The genome was sequenced using the PacBio SMRT system and assembled into a single circular chromosome of 2,347,813 bp with a GC content of 35.26%. Five plasmids were also identified. The genome contains 2,152 protein-encoding ORFs, with 79% assigned a known function and 86% assigned to COG categories. The sequencing and annotation were performed to investigate the molecular basis of the organism's adaptation to extreme environments.",
