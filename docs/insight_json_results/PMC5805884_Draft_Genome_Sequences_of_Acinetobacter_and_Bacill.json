    "document_title": "Draft Genome Sequences of Acinetobacter and Bacillus Strains Isolated from Spacecraft-Associated Surfaces",
    "summary_full": "This paper reports the draft genome sequences of four bacterial strains (Bacillus horneckiae 1P01SCT, Bacillus nealsonii FO-92T, Acinetobacter radioresistens 50v1, and Acinetobacter proteolyticus 2P01AA) isolated from spacecraft-associated surfaces. These strains exhibit increased resistance to stressors like UV radiation and hydrogen peroxide. The genomes were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform and assembled using CLC Genomics Workbench. The study details the genome sizes, number of contigs, and annotations, highlighting genes related to stress resistance, dormancy, sporulation, DNA repair, and quorum sensing. The findings provide insights into the survival mechanisms of microorganisms in extreme environments relevant to space exploration.",
