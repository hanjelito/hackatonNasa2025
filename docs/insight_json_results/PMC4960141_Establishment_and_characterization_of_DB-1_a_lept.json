    "summary_full": "This study describes the establishment and characterization of DB-1, a novel immortalized macrophage cell line derived from leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) mice. The aim was to create an in vitro tool to investigate the role of leptin and its receptor in immune responses, particularly in the context of obesity-associated inflammation. DB-1 cells were generated from bone marrow cells differentiated with M-CSF, spontaneously immortalized, and cloned. The resulting cell line is diploid, exhibits macrophage markers (MAC-2 positive, F4/80 low, CD11b absent, Ly6C intermediate), possesses phagocytic activity comparable to primary macrophages, and responds to interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) by increasing Nos2 transcript levels. Crucially, DB-1 cells are unresponsive to leptin and adipocyte-conditioned media (ACM) in migration assays, unlike wild-type macrophages, confirming their leptin receptor deficiency. This cell line provides a valuable resource for studying leptin's influence on innate immunity and macrophage function.",
