    "document_title": "Thermal Plasticity and Evolutionary Constraints in Bacillus: Implications for Climate Change Adaptation",
    "summary_full": "This study investigated the ability of Bacillus bacteria, common in soil and water, to adapt to rising global temperatures due to climate change. Seven strains from two lineages (Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis) were subjected to experimental evolution under gradually increasing temperatures. While some Bacillus subtilis strains showed minor improvements in heat tolerance, none could grow well at temperatures just 3°C above their natural range. Bacillus cereus strains showed higher mutation rates but did not improve heat tolerance. Convergent evolution was observed in five evolved lines, with mutations in genes related to c-di-AMP synthesis, a molecule involved in regulating potassium levels and implicated for the first time in heat tolerance. The findings highlight the vulnerability of essential bacteria to climate change and suggest that their adaptive capacity may be limited, with potential cascading effects on ecosystems.",

        "B. cereus strains exhibited higher mutation rates but failed to adapt to increased temperatures, while B. subtilis showed distinct adaptive strategies.",
        "Convergent mutations in genes regulating c-di-AMP synthesis (cdaR in B. subtilis, disA in B. cereus) were identified in multiple evolved lines, implicating c-di-AMP in heat tolerance for the first time.",
        "Adaptation to higher temperatures in some B. subtilis lines occurred even when evolved at a constant 37°C, suggesting metabolic adjustments influenced by growth conditions.",
        "Evolutionary adaptation to high temperatures often came with trade-offs, such as reduced growth at lower temperatures, particularly in B. cereus."

    "conclusions": "Bacillus strains exhibit limited thermal adaptation, with lineage-specific outcomes and immediate trade-offs even under prolonged selective pressure. This constrained evolvability has significant implications for microbial responses to global warming, potentially affecting biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem stability. Understanding these evolutionary limits is crucial for predicting the ecological impacts of climate change.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals that essential soil and water bacteria have limited capacity to adapt to projected climate change temperatures, potentially disrupting critical ecosystem functions."
