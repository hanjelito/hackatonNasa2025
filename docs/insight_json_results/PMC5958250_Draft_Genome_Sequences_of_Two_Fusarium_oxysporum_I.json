    "summary_full": "This paper presents the draft whole-genome sequences of two Fusarium oxysporum isolates (VEG-01C1 and VEG-01C2) obtained from Zinnia hybrida plants infected with the fungus during the 'Veggie' project on the International Space Station (ISS). The isolates were cultured from leaf and root tissues. The genomes were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq, with reads processed by Trimmomatic and assembled using ABySS. The resulting draft genomes have sizes of approximately 49.3 Mb and 48.9 Mb, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on 10 informative loci and effector protein presence/absence revealed that these ISS isolates are closely related to F. oxysporum IMV-00293 (originally isolated after the Chernobyl disaster) and the clinical strain FOSC 3-a. This comparative genomics approach could offer insights into genes related to extreme environment adaptation, such as radiation resistance.",
