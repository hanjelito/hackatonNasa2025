    "summary_full": "This perspective piece discusses the growing importance and challenges of applying single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) to samples collected during spaceflight. While these advanced transcriptomic techniques offer unprecedented resolution for understanding gene expression, their application in space is hindered by unique environmental factors and limitations in sample collection and preservation protocols. The authors review current spaceflight-based scRNA-seq studies, highlight the need for optimized tissue preservation methods to maintain RNA integrity and morphology, and explore computational considerations for data analysis. They propose strategies such as in-flight tissue dissection and improved preservation techniques to enable robust scRNA-seq and SRT experiments in space, ultimately aiming to advance our understanding of life in space and develop effective countermeasures for astronaut health.",
