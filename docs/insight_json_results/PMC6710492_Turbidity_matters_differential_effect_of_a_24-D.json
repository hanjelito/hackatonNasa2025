    "summary_full": "This study investigated the impact of AsiMax 50®, a commercial 2,4-D herbicide formulation, on freshwater microbial communities from clear and turbid systems using microcosms. The herbicide was applied at various concentrations over a 7-day period. Results indicated that the turbid system was more affected by the herbicide. In turbid waters, micro + nano phytoplankton abundance increased at low herbicide concentrations, showing a humped-shaped response, while at high concentrations, species richness and abundance decreased in both clear and turbid systems. The study suggests 2,4-D may mimic hormonal functions, with some species exhibiting different responses based on water turbidity. The increase in photosynthetic picoplankton (PPP) in turbid systems was attributed to either increased PE-Pcy abundance or reduced competition from larger phytoplankton. The findings highlight the importance of community-scale approaches in ecotoxicological studies for predicting herbicide impacts on freshwater ecosystems, while cautioning against direct extrapolation from laboratory microcosms.",

    "conclusions": "The turbidity of freshwater systems significantly influences the response of microbial communities to the 2,4-D formulation AsiMax 50®. While high herbicide concentrations generally reduce phytoplankton richness and abundance, low concentrations can stimulate growth in turbid waters, suggesting a potential hormonal mimicry effect of 2,4-D. The study emphasizes the need for community-level ecotoxicological assessments over single-species assays to predict real-world environmental impacts.",
    "impact_statement": "This research highlights how water turbidity alters the ecological impact of the widely used herbicide 2,4-D on freshwater microbial communities, underscoring the importance of considering environmental context in ecotoxicological risk assessments."
