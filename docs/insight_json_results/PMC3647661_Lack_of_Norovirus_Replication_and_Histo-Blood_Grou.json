    "summary_full": "This study investigated the ability of a 3-dimensional (3-D) intestinal model derived from INT-407 cells to support human norovirus (NoV) replication. Previous research suggested this model could support NoV replication, but this study, using highly purified Norwalk virus (NV), found no evidence of viral replication via real-time PCR or immunocytochemical detection of viral proteins. The 3-D cultures also lacked detectable histo-blood group antigens (HBGA), which are crucial for NV binding and host tropism. The observed cytopathic effect (CPE)-like changes in the previous study were replicated by exposing the 3-D cultures to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at concentrations found in stool samples, suggesting that contamination, rather than viral replication, caused the observed effects. The authors conclude that the 3-D INT-407 model is insufficient for studying NoV replication and developing antiviral therapies.",

    "conclusions": "The 3-dimensional INT-407 intestinal cell model does not support Norwalk virus replication and lacks the necessary histo-blood group antigens for viral binding. The observed cytopathic effects in previous studies were likely due to lipopolysaccharide contamination rather than viral infection. Therefore, this model is insufficient for developing vaccines or drugs against norovirus.",
    "impact_statement": "This study demonstrates that a commonly used 3D intestinal cell model is inadequate for norovirus replication, highlighting the need for more sophisticated models to develop effective antiviral strategies against this prevalent pathogen."
