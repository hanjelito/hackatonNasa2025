    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of spaceflight on the ultrastructure and protein expression of mouse sublingual glands using mice flown on the Space Shuttle Discovery (STS-131) and Atlantis (STS-135). Unlike previous findings in parotid glands, no significant structural differences were observed in the sublingual glands of flight mice compared to ground controls. However, protein expression varied. Parotid secretory protein (PSP) expression in serous demilune cells was significantly increased in STS-131 flight mice but decreased in STS-135 flight mice. Mucin (Muc19) and PKA-RII expression showed similar trends but were not statistically significant. Demilune cell and parotid protein (DCPP) was slightly decreased in both flights. These results suggest that salivary gland responses to spaceflight differ across gland types, cell types, and specific proteins, and that the spaceflight environment modifies protein expression. The study highlights the potential for salivary proteins to serve as non-invasive biomarkers for assessing astronaut physiological status.",

    "conclusions": "The study concludes that the sublingual gland's response to spaceflight is distinct from that of the parotid gland, with minimal structural changes but notable alterations in the expression of specific secretory proteins. The observed differences in protein expression between the two space shuttle missions suggest that factors such as the age of the animals play a significant role. These findings underscore the complexity of physiological adaptations to spaceflight and highlight the potential utility of salivary proteins as indicators of an astronaut's physiological status.",
