    "document_title": "Hardware Validation of the Advanced Plant Habitat on ISS: Canopy Photosynthesis in Reduced Gravity",
    "summary_full": "The Advanced Plant Habitat (APH) is the largest plant growth facility on the International Space Station (ISS), designed for long-duration plant research. This paper details a 7-week hardware validation test conducted on the ISS using Arabidopsis and wheat plants. The test aimed to confirm the APH's ability to precisely control environmental parameters (light, CO2, humidity, temperature, moisture) and execute programmed experiment profiles, including photographic events and gas exchange measurements. The APH successfully supported the growth of both plant species in microgravity, demonstrating crew procedures, planting protocols, and watering schemes. The system's capacity to contain plant debris during harvest and manage water recovery through condensation was also validated. Crucially, the APH demonstrated its capability to measure canopy photosynthesis and respiration using non-invasive CO2 drawdown techniques, confirming its readiness for fundamental plant research in spaceflight conditions.",
