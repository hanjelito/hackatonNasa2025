    "document_title": "NemaLife chip: a micropillar-based microfluidic culture device optimized for aging studies in crawling C. elegans",
    "summary_full": "This study introduces the NemaLife chip, a microfluidic device designed for the whole-life culture and aging studies of *C. elegans*. The device features an optimized micropillar arena that allows worms to crawl naturally, sieve channels to separate progeny from adults, and ports for easy feeding and reagent introduction. This design eliminates the need for manual transfers, progeny-blocking drugs, and avoids the stress associated with liquid-based swimming cultures. The NemaLife chip successfully recapitulates typical lifespan outcomes observed on agar plates and allows for the scoring of healthspan measures like pharyngeal pumping and stimulated reversals. The device was validated using classical aging mutants and RNAi knockdown experiments, demonstrating its reliability for aging research.",
