    "summary_full": "This study investigates the potential of fucosylated chondroitin sulfate (PpFucCS) from the sea cucumber Pentacta pygmaea as an inhibitor of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) entry into host cells. HCMV, like many viruses, utilizes cell surface proteoglycans containing heparan sulfate (HS) for initial attachment. The researchers found that native PpFucCS effectively blocks HCMV entry into human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs). When PpFucCS was broken down into smaller molecular weight (LMW) fractions, its inhibitory activity decreased proportionally to the chain length, indicating that higher molecular weight is crucial for maximal antiviral effect. The study also confirmed that PpFucCS and its derivatives are not cytotoxic to HFF cells and can protect them from virus-induced cell death. These findings suggest that PpFucCS is a promising candidate for development into a prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral agent against HCMV infections.",

    "conclusions": "Fucosylated chondroitin sulfate (PpFucCS) from Pentacta pygmaea exhibits significant antiviral activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) by specifically inhibiting its entry into host cells. The high molecular weight of PpFucCS is essential for its maximal inhibitory effect, with activity decreasing as the molecule is fragmented. PpFucCS is non-cytotoxic and protective against virus-induced cell death, making it a promising candidate for further development as an antiviral agent.",
