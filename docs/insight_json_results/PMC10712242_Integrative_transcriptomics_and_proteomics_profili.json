    "summary_full": "This study investigates the molecular and physiological responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to spaceflight conditions (microgravity and radiation) using integrated transcriptomics and proteomics. Seedlings grown on the International Space Station (ISS) were compared to ground controls. Key findings indicate alterations in the photosynthetic machinery, with plants adapting by shifting photosystem core-regulatory proteins in an organ-specific manner. The study also revealed changes in ribosome, spliceosome, and proteasome activities, with an increase in transcripts and proteins related to protease binding and nuclease activities, and a decrease in those involved in tRNA binding and RNA helicase activity. Cell wall synthesis proteins (CESA, CSLE, TFCB) showed reduced abundance, while UDP-ARABINOPYRANOSE MUTASEs involved in non-cellulosic polysaccharide biosynthesis increased. Altered polar auxin redistribution, lipid, and ionic intracellular transport were observed, suggesting increased metabolic energy requirements in space. The research highlights post-transcriptional regulation as a significant factor in spaceflight adaptation and provides insights for sustainable crop production in space.",

    "conclusions": "Spaceflight induces significant molecular and physiological adaptations in Arabidopsis, particularly affecting photosynthesis, cell wall synthesis, intracellular transport, and metabolic energy production. These adaptations are often organ-specific and regulated at the post-transcriptional level, as evidenced by the discordance between transcriptomic and proteomic data. The findings provide crucial insights into plant survival mechanisms in space and have implications for developing sustainable agriculture for long-duration space missions.",
