    "summary_full": "This study reports the draft genome sequence of Sphingomonas strain Sph5, isolated from a tap water filtration membrane. Sphingomonadaceae are known for colonizing membranes and forming biofilms in drinking water systems. The whole genome sequencing and de novo assembly confirmed the isolate as Sphingomonas paucimobilis, distinguishing it from Sphingomonas sanguinis. The genome sequence provides a basis for understanding strain-specific traits related to membrane biofouling. The genome was assembled using Illumina short-read sequencing and SPADES, with annotations predicted by Prokka. The data is available under accession numbers JAMRJL000000000 and SRR25337554.",
