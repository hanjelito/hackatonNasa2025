    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of microgravity (0 G) and artificial gravity (AG) on the optic nerve (ON) and retina (RTN) of mice aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Mice were exposed to 0 G, 0.33 G, 0.67 G, or 1 G of AG for 30 days. RNA sequencing revealed that microgravity induced transcriptomic changes in the ON and RTN associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and lipid metabolic stress. Importantly, artificial gravity attenuated these microgravity-induced transcriptomic responses in a dose-dependent manner, with 1 G providing the strongest attenuation. This was further supported by reduced levels of the oxidative stress biomarker 4-HNE in the retina under higher AG levels. The findings suggest that artificial gravity can serve as a countermeasure to mitigate spaceflight-induced detrimental effects on ocular tissues.",

    "conclusions": "Artificial gravity, particularly at levels near 1 G, can significantly mitigate the transcriptomic alterations in the optic nerve and retina induced by spaceflight. This suggests that AG is a promising countermeasure to protect ocular tissues from detrimental spaceflight effects. Further research is needed to understand the interaction of AG with other spaceflight stressors and to extend observation times post-flight.",
    "impact_statement": "This study demonstrates that artificial gravity can protect the optic nerve and retina from spaceflight-induced molecular damage, offering a potential solution to a critical health concern for astronauts."
