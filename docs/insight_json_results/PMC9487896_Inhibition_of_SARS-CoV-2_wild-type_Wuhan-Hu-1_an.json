    "summary_full": "This study investigates the potential of marine sulfated glycans (MSGs) as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection, focusing on both the wild-type (Wuhan-Hu-1) and the Delta (B.1.617.2) variants. The viral spike glycoprotein (S-protein) plays a crucial role in infection by binding to host cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and ACE2. MSGs have previously shown inhibitory activity by disrupting this S-protein-HSPG interaction. In this research, seven different MSGs were tested against pseudoviruses coated with the S-proteins of the Wuhan-Hu-1 and Delta strains. All tested MSGs demonstrated strong inhibitory activity against both strains, with generally similar efficacy, although slightly weaker against the Delta variant. No direct correlation was found between the structural features of the MSGs and their inhibitory activity. However, the study confirms that MSGs maintain their inhibitory potential against evolving SARS-CoV-2 strains, suggesting their promise as prophylactic and therapeutic agents.",
