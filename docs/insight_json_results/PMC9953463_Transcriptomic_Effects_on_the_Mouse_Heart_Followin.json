    "summary_full": "This study investigated the transcriptomic changes in the hearts of female mice after 30 days of spaceflight on the International Space Station (ISS). RNA sequencing revealed significant regulation of 1147 transcripts. Key pathways predicted to be activated include MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and GPCR signaling. Upregulated transcripts were associated with cytoskeleton breakdown and organization, cell cycle progression, and cellular maintenance/survival. Notably, there was no significant change in transcripts related to extracellular matrix components or oxidative stress, and cellular senescence was not indicated. The findings suggest that the cardiovascular transcriptome initiates an adaptive response to long-term spaceflight, promoting cellular survival and adaptation.",

    "conclusions": "After 30 days of spaceflight on the ISS, the mouse heart exhibits transcriptomic changes indicative of an adaptive response aimed at cellular maintenance and survival. Key signaling pathways like MAPK, PI3K-Akt, and GPCR are activated, supporting cytoskeletal reorganization and cell cycle progression, while avoiding significant induction of oxidative stress or cellular senescence. This suggests the cardiovascular system can adapt to the long-term space environment.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals the adaptive transcriptomic mechanisms in the mouse heart during long-term spaceflight, providing crucial insights for safeguarding astronaut cardiovascular health during extended missions."
