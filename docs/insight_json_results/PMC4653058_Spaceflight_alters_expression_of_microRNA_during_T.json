    "summary_full": "This study investigated the hypothesis that spaceflight alters microRNA (miRNA) expression, contributing to altered immune function observed in astronauts. Human leukocytes were stimulated with mitogens on the International Space Station (ISS) using an onboard normal gravity control. Results showed that miR-21 was significantly up-regulated during early T-cell activation in normal gravity, but its expression was suppressed under microgravity. This was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Global microarray analysis revealed significant suppression of 85 genes under microgravity compared to normal gravity. Several biologically confirmed miR-21 target genes, including EGR3, FASLG, BTG2, SPRY2, and TAGAP, were co-up-regulated with miR-21 and share common promoter regions with pre-miR-21. The findings suggest that gravity regulates T-cell activation not only through transcriptional promotion but also by blocking translation via noncoding RNA mechanisms, indicating a self-limiting induction process for T-cell activation mediated by miR-21.",

    "conclusions": "Spaceflight significantly alters microRNA expression, specifically suppressing miR-21 during T-cell activation. This suppression, along with the altered expression of miR-21 target genes, suggests that gravity plays a crucial role in regulating T-cell activation through both transcriptional and translational mechanisms. The study proposes a novel self-limiting induction mechanism for T-cell activation mediated by miR-21, which may have broader implications for understanding immune regulation and disease.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals a novel mechanism by which microgravity affects the human immune system at the molecular level, highlighting the critical role of microRNAs in T-cell activation and suggesting potential targets for mitigating immune dysfunction during space exploration."
