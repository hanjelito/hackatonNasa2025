    "summary_full": "This study investigates the effects of space microgravity (SPC-µG) on human neural stem cells (NSCs), focusing on cell division abnormalities. Previous research indicated enhanced proliferation and larger cell diameter of NSCs in microgravity. This study reports a frequent occurrence of abnormal cell division (ACD), including incomplete cell division (ICD) and multi-daughter cell division (MDCD), in NSCs exposed to SPC-µG and their secretome compared to ground controls. These findings suggest potential health risks for astronauts, including increased susceptibility to neurological disorders and cancer, and highlight the need for preventive measures. The study also identified SPARC as a potentially key molecule secreted by NSCs in space that may mediate these effects.",

    "conclusions": "Space microgravity induces significant abnormalities in neural stem cell division, including incomplete and multi-daughter cell divisions. These effects are mediated, at least in part, by secreted factors, with SPARC being a key candidate. These findings have critical implications for astronaut health during long-term space missions, potentially increasing the risk of neurological disorders and cancer, and underscore the need for countermeasures.",
    "impact_statement": "This research reveals that space microgravity disrupts neural stem cell division, posing risks for astronaut brain health and potentially increasing cancer susceptibility, necessitating the development of protective strategies for space exploration."
