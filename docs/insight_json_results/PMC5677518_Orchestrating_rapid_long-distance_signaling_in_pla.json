    "document_title": "Orchestrating rapid long-distance signaling in plants with Ca2+, ROS and electrical signals",
    "summary_full": "Plants exhibit rapid systemic responses to environmental stresses, where signals from the point of perception are transmitted to distant organs. A network involving reactive oxygen species (ROS), Ca2+, and electrical signaling ('trio signaling') appears to facilitate this rapid transmission. Key molecular components like RBOHD (ROS production), TPC1 (ion channel), and GLR3.3/3.6 (glutamate receptor-like channels) are being identified. The cell wall's role in signal propagation, either limiting or facilitating it, and the function of plasmodesmata as conduits and gatekeepers remain open questions. Regardless of the exact pathway, these signals help prepare plants for impending biotic or abiotic challenges.",

    "conclusions": "The 'trio signaling' network of ROS, Ca2+, and electrical signals plays a crucial role in rapid, long-distance communication within plants, preparing them for environmental stresses. While key molecular players are being identified, the exact pathways of signal transmission through the cell wall and plasmodesmata, and the interplay between general priming signals and stress-specific signals, remain areas for future research.",
    "impact_statement": "This research sheds light on the fundamental mechanisms of plant communication, crucial for understanding plant responses to stress and for developing strategies to enhance crop resilience."
