    "summary_full": "Spaceflight causes skeletal muscle atrophy and weakness, partly due to calcium (Ca2+) dysregulation. This study investigated if the antioxidant BuOE could mitigate these effects in the soleus muscle of space-flown mice. Results showed that spaceflight significantly reduced the soleus:body mass ratio and increased sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ leak, as indicated by a lower ionophore ratio and increased 4-HNE (a marker of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, RONS). These negative effects were not rescued by BuOE treatment. The study concludes that spaceflight induces muscle atrophy and SR Ca2+ leak, and BuOE is ineffective in counteracting these changes. Future research should explore alternative therapeutics targeting SERCA activation or Ca2+ leak.",

    "conclusions": "Spaceflight induces significant soleus muscle atrophy and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ leak, which are not counteracted by treatment with the antioxidant BuOE. While BuOE improved SERCA's affinity for Ca2+, it failed to mitigate the detrimental effects of spaceflight on muscle mass and SR Ca2+ handling, suggesting that BuOE is not an effective therapeutic for spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy and dysfunction.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals that a common antioxidant treatment is ineffective against spaceflight-induced muscle atrophy and calcium leak, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic strategies to maintain muscle health during space missions."
