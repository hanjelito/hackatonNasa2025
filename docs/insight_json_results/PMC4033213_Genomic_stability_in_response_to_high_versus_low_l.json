    "summary_full": "This study investigates the differential effects of high-linear energy transfer (LET) HZE particles and low-LET gamma rays on DNA damage and repair in Arabidopsis thaliana. Researchers exposed wild-type and various DNA repair/cell-cycle checkpoint-deficient mutants to these radiation types. They found that HZE particles are approximately 2-4 times more biologically effective than gamma rays in causing root growth inhibition and inducing loss of heterozygosity (LOH), indicating more complex and damaging DNA lesions. Mutants deficient in DNA repair (lig4, ku80) showed increased sensitivity to both radiation types, highlighting the importance of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) for repairing complex double-strand breaks. The study also revealed a shift in the relative importance of ATM and ATR checkpoints, with ATR playing a more significant role in response to HZE radiation, suggesting increased single-stranded DNA generation or repair challenges associated with high-LET damage.",

The complexity of DNA damage induced by HZE particles influences the choice and effectiveness of DNA repair pathways, with ATR playing a more prominent role in response to this type of radiation. The findings highlight the importance of understanding differential radiation effects for biological systems, particularly in the context of space exploration.",
