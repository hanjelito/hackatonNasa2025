    "summary_full": "This study investigates the effects of low-dose charged particle irradiation, relevant to space travel, on neural stem cells and cognitive function. Researchers found that even low doses (<1 Gy) of charged particles induce acute and persistent oxidative stress in neural stem and precursor cells, lasting weeks to months. This oxidative stress was observed even at ion fluences where less than one ion traversed each cell. In whole-body irradiated mice, the brain mounted a temporary compensatory antioxidant response that returned to baseline levels. Crucially, low-dose irradiation significantly impaired novel object recognition in mice at both 2 and 12 weeks post-exposure. The findings suggest that space radiation poses a risk for mission-critical performance decrements and long-term neurocognitive issues for astronauts.",
