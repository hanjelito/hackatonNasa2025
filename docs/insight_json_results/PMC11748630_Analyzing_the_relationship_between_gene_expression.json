    "summary_full": "Spaceflight negatively impacts rodent liver function, leading to phenotypes like lipid dysregulation, which are reflected in transcriptomic changes. Traditional correlation-based methods often identify spurious correlations. This study utilizes the Causal Research and Inference Search Platform (CRISP), a machine learning ensemble of causal inference methods, to identify genes robustly correlated with a lipid density phenotype in space-flown mice liver tissue. By augmenting the dataset with various transformations and considering library preparation as an environmental factor, CRISP identified genes and molecular targets not found by standard differential gene expression analyses. These identified genes are strongly associated with lipid metabolism and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) pathways, suggesting their pivotal role in spaceflight-induced liver dysfunction. The approach offers a novel way to identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for space travel countermeasures.",
