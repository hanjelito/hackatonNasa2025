    "document_title": "Altered Disc Compression in Children with Idiopathic Low Back Pain: An Upright MRI Backpack Study",
    "summary_full": "This study investigated the lumbar spine's response to common backpack loads in children with idiopathic low back pain (ILBP) using upright MRI, comparing them to previously studied normal children. Fifteen ILBP children (mean age 13) were imaged supine and standing with 0, 4, and 8 kg backpacks. Results showed that in ILBP children, only the L5-S1 intervertebral disc (IVD) was compressed by backpack loads, unlike in normal children where all lumbar discs showed compression. ILBP children also experienced significantly less lumbar lordosis and more pain with increasing backpack loads compared to normal children. These findings suggest altered load tolerance mechanisms in ILBP children, potentially involving increased reliance on paraspinal musculature.",

    "conclusions": "In children with idiopathic low back pain, increasing backpack load selectively compresses the L5-S1 disc. Compared to normal children, these children experience less overall lumbar IVD compression, reduced lumbar lordosis, and increased pain with backpack loading, suggesting altered mechanisms for load tolerance. These findings may indicate a greater reliance on paraspinal musculature, which could be targeted by physical therapy.",
