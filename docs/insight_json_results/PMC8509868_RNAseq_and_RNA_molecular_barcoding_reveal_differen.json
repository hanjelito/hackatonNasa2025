    "summary_full": "This study investigated the molecular changes in cortical bone of female mice subjected to hindlimb unloading (HLU) for 7 days, a model for disuse-induced bone loss. Using RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and RNA molecular barcoding (NanoString), the researchers aimed to identify genes whose mRNA expression changes in response to reduced mechanical loading. They found alterations in genes related to Wnt signaling and metabolism, including the upregulation of Pfkfb3 and Mss51. These findings suggest novel roles for these genes in the bone's response to mechanical stress and highlight the potential for identifying new therapeutic targets to combat osteoporosis caused by disuse.",
