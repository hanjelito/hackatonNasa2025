    "summary_full": "This study investigates a countermeasure strategy to mitigate space radiation damage by inhibiting specific microRNAs (miRNAs). Researchers used 3D microvessel cell cultures exposed to simulated deep space radiation and treated them with antagomirs targeting miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p. The treatment significantly reduced inflammation and DNA double-strand break (DSB) activity, while also rescuing mitochondrial functions. The study also analyzed data from astronaut missions (NASA Twin Study, Inspiration4, JAXA) to confirm that the genes and pathways affected by the antagomirs are altered in humans. The findings suggest that targeting these miRNAs could be a viable strategy to protect astronauts from space radiation-induced health risks.",

    "conclusions": "Inhibition of miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p using antagomirs effectively mitigates space radiation-induced damage in microvessel cells by reducing inflammation, DNA damage, and restoring mitochondrial function. These findings, supported by astronaut data, suggest a promising therapeutic strategy for protecting astronauts from the detrimental effects of space radiation.",
    "impact_statement": "This research offers a potential therapeutic countermeasure using microRNA inhibition to protect astronauts from space radiation damage, crucial for enabling long-duration space missions."
