    "summary_full": "This study investigates the physiological and structural changes in the utricle, a key organ for sensing gravity and acceleration, in oyster toadfish exposed to altered gravity conditions. Using centrifugation to simulate hypergravity (HG) and examining responses to acceleration, the researchers found that utricular afferent sensitivity adjusts based on the magnitude and duration of HG exposure. Initially, sensitivity increased after short exposures (3-4 days), followed by a decrease after longer exposures (16-32 days). Readaptation to normal 1 g gravity also showed time-dependent recovery. Interestingly, despite significant physiological changes in afferent sensitivity, the number of synaptic bodies in hair cells remained consistent across different gravity conditions. The efferent vestibular pathway did not appear to play a significant role in regulating these adaptive responses. The findings suggest that the utricle exhibits plasticity in response to altered gravity, with readaptation processes from HG partially mimicking adaptation to microgravity.",

    "conclusions": "The utricle demonstrates significant plasticity in response to altered gravity, adapting its afferent sensitivity in a time- and magnitude-dependent manner. While synaptic structure appears stable, the physiological response of afferents changes, suggesting complex adaptive mechanisms are at play. The readaptation process back to normal gravity partially mirrors adaptation to microgravity, highlighting a conserved response to gravitational transitions.",
