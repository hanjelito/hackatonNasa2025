    "document_title": "Prolonged Exposure to Microgravity Reduces Cardiac Contractility and Initiates Remodeling in Drosophila",
    "summary_full": "This study investigates the effects of prolonged microgravity exposure on cardiac function and structure using the Drosophila model. Flies reared in microgravity exhibited reduced cardiac contractility, characterized by cardiac constriction, myofibrillar remodeling, and diminished output. Transcriptomic analysis of isolated hearts revealed decreased expression of sarcomeric and extracellular matrix (ECM) genes, alongside a significant increase in proteasomal gene expression, suggesting impaired proteostasis. Further experiments confirmed elevated proteasome aggregates, amyloid, and polyQ deposits in microgravity-exposed hearts. These findings indicate that cardiac remodeling and proteostatic stress are fundamental responses of heart muscle to microgravity, with implications for human health during long-duration space exploration.",

    "conclusions": "Prolonged exposure to microgravity induces significant cardiac remodeling and functional decline in Drosophila, characterized by reduced contractility and altered myofibrillar structure. These changes are associated with dysregulation of sarcomeric and extracellular matrix genes, and a marked increase in proteasomal activity, suggesting a fundamental role for proteostatic stress in microgravity-induced cardiac pathology. These findings highlight the potential risks to cardiovascular health during long-duration space missions and underscore the importance of further research in this area.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals that microgravity significantly impairs heart function and structure in a model organism, identifying proteostatic stress as a key factor, which is crucial for understanding and mitigating cardiovascular risks in astronauts during extended space missions."
