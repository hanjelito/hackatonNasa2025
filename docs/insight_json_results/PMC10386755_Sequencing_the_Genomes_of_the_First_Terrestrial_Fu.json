    "summary_full": "This review explores the significant advancements in understanding early-diverging terrestrial fungi, primarily the zygomycetes (Mucoromycota and Zoopagomycota), through genome sequencing. Since the first zygomycete genome was sequenced in 2008, over 1000 genomes have become available, revealing deep phylogenetic separations and insights into their evolution on land. Genomic data have illuminated adaptations to terrestrial life, such as light and gravity sensing, hyphal growth, and interactions with early plants. Studies have also detailed genome architecture, including gene duplications, horizontal gene transfer, mating type loci, and the distribution of transposable elements. Furthermore, genomic analyses have identified pathogenicity genes, specialized metabolites, and novel endosymbiotic bacteria and viruses. The review covers sequencing and assembly methodologies, genome statistics, and the evolutionary implications for Mucoromycota and Zoopagomycota, including their roles as plant symbionts, pathogens, and animal parasites. It highlights key findings such as the prevalence of diploidy, the role of genome duplication, the impact of endosymbionts, and the diversity of secreted enzymes and secondary metabolites. The review concludes by emphasizing the ongoing importance of zygomycete genomics for resolving evolutionary questions and addressing biotechnological and medical challenges, with future research focusing on improved genome quality and comparative analyses.",
