    "summary_full": "This study conducted a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of the Proline-Rich Extensin-Like Receptor Kinase (PERK) gene family in Brassica napus, identifying 50 BnPERK genes. These genes were classified into four groups, unevenly distributed across chromosomes, and showed evidence of purifying selection during evolution. Structural analysis revealed significant diversification in gene length, molecular weight, and isoelectric points, with conserved tyrosine kinase domains suggesting functional importance. Cis-element analysis predicted roles in hormone signaling and stress responses. Expression profiling indicated diverse patterns across tissues and hormone treatments, suggesting involvement in growth regulation and hormone signaling. Protein-protein interaction networks implicated BnPERK proteins in various biological processes. Notably, the downregulation of four BnPERK genes upon infection with Plasmodiophora brassicae, the causal agent of clubroot disease, suggested a role in disease response. Further investigation using an Arabidopsis perk9 mutant showed reduced disease severity and enhanced basal immunity, indicating a negative role of PERK9 in plant immunity. The findings highlight the potential of BnPERKs for crop improvement strategies against clubroot disease.",

    "conclusions": "The study comprehensively analyzed the BnPERK gene family in Brassica napus, revealing their evolutionary dynamics, structural diversity, and functional roles in growth regulation, hormone signaling, and stress responses. Crucially, the research identified a role for specific BnPERK genes, particularly BnPERK09A1 and BnPERK09C1, in the plant's response to clubroot disease, with evidence suggesting PERK9 negatively regulates plant immunity. These findings provide valuable insights for developing strategies to improve clubroot resistance in Brassica crops.",
