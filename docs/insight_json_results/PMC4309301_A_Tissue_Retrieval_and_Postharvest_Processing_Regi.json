    "summary_full": "This study developed and validated a strategy for collecting and processing rodent reproductive tissues to preserve their quality for long-term storage on the International Space Station (ISS) and for postflight biospecimen sharing. The researchers determined optimal time windows for tissue harvest after euthanasia, ranging from 1 to 3 hours depending on the tissue and species, to maintain histological integrity. They also established methods for ISS-compatible long-term storage (10 months at -80째C) that successfully preserved high-quality mRNA and protein for downstream analysis, such as Western blotting. The protocol, focusing on reproductive tissues like testes, epididymides, ovaries, and uteri from mice and gerbils, is adaptable for other tissues and multi-investigator sharing programs.",

    "conclusions": "The study successfully established and validated a comprehensive regimen for harvesting and processing rodent reproductive tissues that maintains histological integrity and molecular quality (RNA and protein) for up to 10 months of storage at -80째C. These methods are compatible with the constraints of spaceflight, such as on the ISS, and facilitate safe shipping of samples, making them suitable for multi-investigator biospecimen sharing programs.",
    "impact_statement": "This research provides a critical framework for preserving biological samples from spaceflight animal experiments, enabling more robust and comprehensive studies of physiological changes in microgravity."
