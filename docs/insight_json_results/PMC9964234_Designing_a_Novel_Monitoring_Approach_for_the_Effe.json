    "summary_full": "This study reanalyzed a publicly available microarray dataset (E-GEOD-74708) from 10 astronauts to identify gene expression and correlation patterns affected by space travel. The analysis revealed 218 differentially expressed genes between in-flight and pre-flight conditions, indicating that space travel decreases genome regulation and gene correlations. Notably, gene expression coordination did not significantly recover post-flight, suggesting long-lasting effects. The researchers identified a shortlist of 32 genes that could serve as biomarkers for a rapid assay to monitor astronauts' health during space missions. The study also explored potential drug and miRNA interventions targeting these genes and highlighted the need for further validation, including microgravity experiments.",

    "conclusions": "Space travel significantly impacts astronauts' health by altering gene expression and reducing genome regulation and gene correlations. A novel, rapid assay based on a shortlist of 32 genes is proposed for monitoring these health effects. Further validation and integration with other monitoring methods are necessary for a comprehensive approach to astronaut health in space.",
