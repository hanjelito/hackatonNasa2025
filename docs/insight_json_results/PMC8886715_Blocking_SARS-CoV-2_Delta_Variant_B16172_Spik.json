    "summary_full": "This study reports the development of human host defense peptide-conjugated graphene quantum dots (GQDs) as a strategy to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 delta variant (B.1.617.2) infections. The researchers conjugated neutrophil Î±-defensin HNP1 and cathelicidin LL-37 peptides onto GQDs. These peptide-conjugated GQDs were shown to effectively bind to the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the delta variant, with a binding affinity comparable to the ACE2-spike protein interaction. The binding of the peptide-GQDs to the spike protein resulted in fluorescence quenching, indicating a strong interaction. Further experiments using HEK293T cells expressing ACE2 demonstrated that the peptide-conjugated GQDs completely inhibited the entry of delta variant SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirions into host cells by blocking the ACE2-spike protein binding. The combination of both HNP1 and LL-37 peptides on GQDs showed higher inhibition efficiency than single-peptide conjugates or peptides alone. Additionally, TEM and SEM imaging revealed that the peptide-conjugated GQDs could damage the virus's lipid membrane, leading to virus collapse and removal of spike proteins, thus preventing infection.",
