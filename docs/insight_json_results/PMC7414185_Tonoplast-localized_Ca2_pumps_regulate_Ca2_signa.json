    "summary_full": "This study investigates the role of tonoplast-localized Ca2+ pumps, specifically ACA4 and ACA11, in regulating calcium (Ca2+) signaling during pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) in Arabidopsis thaliana. The researchers found that mutants lacking these pumps (aca4/11) exhibit elevated basal Ca2+ levels and exaggerated Ca2+ signals in response to the bacterial elicitor peptide flg22. These aberrant Ca2+ dynamics are linked to immune-related phenotypes, including spontaneous lesion formation. The study demonstrates that relocalizing a plasma membrane Ca2+ pump (ACA8) to the tonoplast can rescue these phenotypes, suggesting that Ca2+ sequestration at the tonoplast is crucial for proper PTI signaling. Furthermore, elevated temperatures suppress both the Ca2+ signaling defects and defense phenotypes in the aca4/11 mutants. The findings highlight the importance of tonoplast Ca2+ pumps in maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis and shaping Ca2+ signatures during plant immune responses, while also suggesting that the specific regulatory mechanisms of endogenous tonoplast pumps may not be essential for these signaling events.",

    "conclusions": "Tonoplast-localized Ca2+ pumps ACA4 and ACA11 are critical for maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis and properly regulating Ca2+ signals during pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) in Arabidopsis. Their absence leads to elevated Ca2+ levels and exaggerated responses to elicitors like flg22, impacting defense pathways. The ability of a plasma membrane pump, ACA8, to rescue these phenotypes when targeted to the tonoplast suggests that the fundamental Ca2+ transport activity at this organelle is key, rather than specific regulatory mechanisms of endogenous tonoplast pumps. Temperature also plays a significant role in modulating these responses.",
