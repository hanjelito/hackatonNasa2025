    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of spaceflight on gene expression in specific regions of the mouse brain (Cortex, Frontal Cortex, Cornu Ammonis I, and Dentate Gyrus) using GeoMx Digital Spatial Profiling. Spaceflight induced hundreds of differentially expressed genes in all four regions, with common and region-specific responses observed. Enriched pathways were related to metabolism and oxidative stress. Treatment with the antioxidant BuOE (MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+) during spaceflight attenuated a significant number of these spaceflight-induced gene expression changes, suggesting its potential to mitigate oxidative stress-related brain damage caused by spaceflight. The findings highlight regional variations in brain susceptibility to spaceflight and the potential of BuOE as a neuroprotective agent.",

    "conclusions": "Spaceflight induces significant, region-specific changes in gene expression in the mouse brain, particularly in metabolic and oxidative stress-related pathways. These changes are partially reversed by treatment with the antioxidant BuOE, suggesting its potential to mitigate spaceflight-induced neurobiological damage. The study highlights the vulnerability of certain brain regions to spaceflight and provides a foundation for developing neuroprotective strategies for astronauts.",
    "impact_statement": "This research reveals how spaceflight affects gene expression in the brain and demonstrates the potential of an antioxidant to protect against these changes, crucial for safeguarding astronaut health during long-duration missions."
