    "summary_full": "This paper addresses the emerging ethical, legal, and medical policy concerns arising from the increase in non-governmental and commercial space exploration. It focuses on the selection of space travelers and the conduct of human subject research in this new era. Historically, government-sponsored spaceflights had stringent regulations for astronaut selection and research. However, with the rise of private companies like SpaceX, Boeing, and Blue Origin, a more diverse group of individuals, including civilians, are traveling to space. This shift necessitates a re-evaluation of existing guidelines, as current regulations are often insufficient for non-professional space travelers and commercial operations. The paper highlights the significant health hazards of spaceflight, including radiation exposure, altered gravity, isolation, and confinement, and discusses the ethical challenges in assessing and accepting risks for these new spaceflight occupants (SOs). It also examines the complexities of human subject research in space, particularly concerning informed consent, data privacy, and the ability for participants to withdraw from studies. The authors argue for the development of unified ethical guidelines to ensure human well-being and maintain high medical and ethical standards in this evolving landscape of space exploration.",

    "conclusions": "The burgeoning age of non-governmental space exploration, marked by commercial and private ventures, introduces novel ethical, legal, and medical challenges. Existing regulatory frameworks, designed for government-sponsored astronauts, are insufficient for the diverse population of spaceflight occupants (SOs) and the nature of commercial operations. Addressing these gaps requires the development of unified ethical guidelines to ensure the safety and well-being of individuals involved in space travel and research, covering traveler selection, human subject research, and decision-making processes. Proactive implementation of these guidelines is crucial for maintaining the highest ethical and medical standards as space exploration expands.",
    "impact_statement": "This paper highlights critical ethical considerations for the rapidly growing non-governmental space exploration sector, advocating for new guidelines to protect human participants in space travel and research."
