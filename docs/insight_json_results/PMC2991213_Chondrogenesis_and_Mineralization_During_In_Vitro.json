    "summary_full": "This study investigates the influence of culture duration and medium additives on the development of engineered tissues from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) on three-dimensional (3D) woven poly(É›-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffolds. hMSCs were cultured for 1, 21, or 45 days in either chondrogenic or osteogenic medium. Results showed that chondrogenic medium promoted the formation of cartilaginous tissue by day 21, with subsequent hypertrophic mineralization observed by day 45 at the interface between the engineered tissue and the scaffold. The composition, mechanical properties, and gene expression were significantly affected by both culture duration and medium type. Constructs cultured for 45 days in chondrogenic medium exhibited mechanical properties comparable to native articular cartilage. Gene expression analysis indicated sequential regulation of markers for chondrogenesis and endochondral bone formation. In contrast, osteogenic medium resulted in limited osteogenesis. These findings suggest that long-term culture on 3D scaffolds can induce chondrogenesis and regional mineralization, offering potential for osteochondral defect repair.",

    "conclusions": "Culture duration and medium additives significantly influence the differentiation of hMSCs on 3D woven PCL scaffolds, leading to the formation of cartilaginous tissue with regional mineralization under chondrogenic conditions. These findings highlight the potential of this system for osteochondral defect repair, suggesting that long-term culture can promote a hypertrophic chondrocyte phenotype and subsequent mineralization.",
