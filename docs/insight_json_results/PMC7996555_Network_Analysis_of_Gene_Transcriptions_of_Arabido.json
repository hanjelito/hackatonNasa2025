    "summary_full": "This study analyzes transcriptomic datasets of Arabidopsis thaliana grown on the International Space Station to understand the impact of microgravity on root growth gene expression. Using computational tools based on graph theory, including LASSO, Pearson correlation, and HITS algorithms, gene regulatory networks (GRNs) were inferred. Spectral analyses revealed distinct network properties for different ecotypes (WS, Col-0, and phyD mutant) under spaceflight conditions. Key findings indicate that significantly altered hub genes in microgravity are involved in cell wall synthesis, protein transport, auxin response, stress responses, and catabolic processes. Notably, five root growth-regulating hub genes with high outdegree in spaceflight GRNs were identified, along with genes encoding nucleotide-diphospho-sugar interconversion enzymes that show higher transcriptional regulation and are involved in cell wall biosynthesis. The study highlights the utility of network analysis in understanding genotype-to-phenotype relationships in spaceflight environments.",

    "conclusions": "Graph-based network analysis, including LASSO, Pearson correlation, and HITS algorithms, effectively identified gene regulatory networks and key hub genes in Arabidopsis thaliana under spaceflight microgravity. The study highlights that spaceflight significantly alters gene expression related to root growth, particularly in cell wall biosynthesis and stress responses. The identified hub genes and pathways provide insights into plant adaptation mechanisms in space, bridging the gap between genotype and phenotype.",
