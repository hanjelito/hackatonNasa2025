    "document_title": "Draft Genome Sequences of Tremellomycetes Strains Isolated from the International Space Station",
    "summary_full": "This study reports the draft genome assemblies of six eukaryotic microbial strains belonging to the class Tremellomycetes, which were isolated from the International Space Station (ISS). The strains include four non-neoformans Cryptococcus species: Naganishia adeliensis, Naganishia albida (two strains), and Naganishia sp., along with two strains of Papiliotrema laurentii. The genome sequencing was performed using Illumina NovaSeq 6000, and the data were assembled using SPAdes. The species were identified based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences. The isolation of these species from the ISS highlights their persistence in microgravity conditions, and their genome sequences will facilitate further research into their potential pathogenicity and adaptation to space environments.",
