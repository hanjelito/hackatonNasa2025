    "summary_full": "Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a progressive condition with limited effective treatments. This study employed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to identify novel drug targets for CKD by investigating the causal relationship between the expression of druggable genes and CKD risk. Using cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) data from the eQTLGen Consortium as exposure and genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for CKD from the FinnGen database as outcome, the researchers analyzed 4,479 druggable genes. MR analysis identified 12 genes significantly associated with CKD risk. Functional enrichment analyses (GO and KEGG) revealed these genes are involved in pathways such as MAP kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, Gap junction, Platelet activation, and Oxytocin signaling. Colocalization analysis strongly suggested that the TUBB gene shares a causal variant with CKD (posterior probability > 80%). The study concludes that TUBB, encoding β-tubulin, is a promising pharmacological target for CKD treatment, offering insights for future drug development.",
