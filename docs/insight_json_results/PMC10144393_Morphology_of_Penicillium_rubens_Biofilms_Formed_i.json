    "document_title": "Morphology of Penicillium rubens Biofilms Formed in Space",
    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effect of microgravity on the formation and morphology of Penicillium rubens biofilms on seven different material surfaces (Stainless Steel 316, Aluminum Alloy, Titanium Alloy, Carbon Fiber, Quartz, Silicone, and Nanograss) aboard the International Space Station over 10, 15, and 20 days. While microgravity generally did not induce significant changes in biofilm shape, biomass, thickness, or surface area coverage compared to Earth-based controls, there were material- and time-dependent variations. Nanograss showed significantly less biofilm formation across all conditions, suggesting it may interfere with hyphal adhesion or spore germination. A decrease in biofilm formation at 20 days was observed in some cases, potentially due to nutrient depletion, which was also material-dependent. The study highlights the complex interplay between microgravity, material properties, and incubation time on fungal biofilm development in space.",

        "Biofilm formation was significantly reduced on Nanograss material in both space and Earth conditions, indicating its potential as an anti-biofilm surface.",
        "Microgravity led to increased biofilm formation in specific instances (e.g., surface area on Carbon Fiber and Stainless Steel at 15 days, thickness on Titanium Alloy at 10 and 20 days).",
        "Conversely, microgravity resulted in decreased biofilm formation in other cases (e.g., surface area on Carbon Fiber at 10 days, thickness on Quartz at 20 days).",
        "A decrease in biofilm formation at 20 days was observed on some materials, potentially due to nutrient depletion, suggesting a starvation state.",
        "No consistent visual trends in the 3D structure of biofilms were observed across different gravity conditions or materials."

    "conclusions": "Microgravity does not significantly alter the overall morphology of Penicillium rubens biofilms up to 20 days of incubation. While specific instances of increased or decreased biofilm formation were observed in microgravity, these effects were material- and time-dependent and lacked a consistent trend. Nanograss shows promise as a material that inhibits fungal biofilm formation. Nutrient depletion may limit biofilm growth over longer incubation periods, and the potential for persister cell formation warrants further investigation for long-term space missions.",
    "impact_statement": "This study provides crucial insights into fungal biofilm behavior in microgravity, informing strategies for preventing microbial contamination and protecting astronaut health and spacecraft integrity during long-duration space missions."
