    "document_title": "Mice in Bion-M 1 Space Mission: Training and Selection",
    "summary_full": "This paper details the scientific goals, experimental design, and the crucial mouse training and selection program for the Bion-M 1 biosatellite mission, which marked Russia's return to space biomedical research after a 16-year hiatus. The 30-day mission aimed to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms of physiological adaptation to microgravity using male C57/BL6 mice. The study combined in-flight and post-flight in vivo measurements, including continuous blood pressure monitoring, with extensive in vitro analyses. A significant focus was placed on co-adapting aggressive male mice for group housing and adapting them to a specialized paste food diet. A comprehensive training program for mice designated for in vivo studies included behavioral and functional tests to ensure homogenous groups. Post-flight, mice showed signs of pronounced disadaptation to Earth's gravity. The authors conclude that their training program was effective, demonstrating that male mice can be successfully utilized in space biomedical research, though hardware malfunctions and microgravity-induced behavioral changes presented challenges.",

    "conclusions": "The Bion-M 1 mission successfully demonstrated that male mice can be effectively trained and utilized for space biomedical research, provided specific procedures for group housing and adaptation are followed. Challenges related to hardware malfunctions and microgravity-induced behavioral changes were identified, highlighting the need for improved habitat design, particularly the avoidance of moving parts. The implementation of telemetry and extensive video recording significantly enhanced data collection and provided valuable insights into animal welfare and behavior.",
