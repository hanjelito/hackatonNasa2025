    "summary_full": "This study investigates the mechanisms behind the increased virulence of the opportunistic bacterium Serratia marcescens when exposed to simulated microgravity (LSMMG). Previous research showed that LSMMG-treated S. marcescens caused higher mortality rates in Drosophila melanogaster hosts. This study found that LSMMG increases asparagine uptake and synthesis in S. marcescens. The increased host lethality observed in rich media could be replicated in minimal media by adding aspartate and glutamine, the substrates for asparagine biosynthesis. Interestingly, increased bacterial growth rate alone, induced by aspartate supplementation, did not fully account for the maximal host lethality. However, the addition of both aspartate and glutamine led to increased host mortality and LSMMG-dependent overexpression of asparagine pathway genes. Furthermore, L-asparaginase, an enzyme that breaks down asparagine, was found to be an effective countermeasure against the increased host mortality caused by LSMMG-treated bacteria. This research highlights the role of the asparagine utilization pathway in microgravity-induced virulence and suggests L-asparaginase as a potential mitigation strategy.",

    "conclusions": "The study concludes that the asparagine biosynthesis pathway is a critical determinant of the increased host mortality induced by Serratia marcescens under simulated microgravity conditions. Microgravity appears to prime S. marcescens to out-compete host immune cells for asparagine utilization, leading to heightened virulence. L-asparaginase demonstrates potential as a therapeutic agent against such infections.",
