    "summary_full": "This study investigates the role of Spag4, a Drosophila ortholog of mammalian SUN proteins, in spermatogenesis. Spag4 is crucial for attaching the centriole/basal body (BB) to the spermatid nucleus after meiosis. Unlike typical LINC complexes, this process does not involve Drosophila KASH proteins (Klarsicht and MSP-300) but requires the coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin. Spag4 and Yuri exhibit similar dynamic localization patterns during spermatogenesis, concentrating at the nuclear envelope, then at the centriole attachment site and along the nucleus. Epistasis studies reveal that Yuri and dynein-dynactin function downstream of Spag4. Mutations in spag4 and yuri lead to similar defects, including dissociation of nuclei and centrioles, failed individualization of spermatids, and male sterility, suggesting these later defects are secondary to the initial disruption of nuclear-basal body association.",

    "conclusions": "Spag4, a SUN protein in Drosophila, plays a critical role in anchoring the basal body to the spermatid nucleus during spermatogenesis. This function is mediated through a novel pathway involving the coiled-coil protein Yuri Gagarin and dynein-dynactin, rather than the canonical LINC complex formed with KASH proteins. The observed defects in later spermatid individualization stages in spag4 and yuri mutants are likely secondary consequences of the initial failure in basal body-nuclear attachment.",
