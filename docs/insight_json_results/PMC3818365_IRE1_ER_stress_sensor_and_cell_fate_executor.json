    "document_title": "IRE1: ER stress sensor and cell fate executor",
    "summary_full": "This review discusses the Inositol-Requiring Enzyme 1 (IRE1), a key sensor of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and a central regulator of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in eukaryotes. It details how IRE1 monitors ER homeostasis and triggers UPR to maintain cellular function, highlighting its dual role in promoting cell survival and initiating apoptosis. The review compares IRE1 characteristics across species, particularly between plants and animals, and explores emerging mechanisms of IRE1 sensing and signaling. It emphasizes IRE1's role as an executor of cell fate determination under ER stress, mediated through RNA splicing and regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD). The discussion covers the UPR arms in different eukaryotes, the revised model of IRE1α signaling in mammals, substrate specificity, and the distinct roles of IRE1 in plants versus animals. Finally, it outlines future research directions in UPR, focusing on in vivo studies and a deeper understanding of IRE1's complex regulatory network.",

    "conclusions": "IRE1 is a crucial sensor and executor of cell fate decisions during ER stress, coordinating adaptive responses and apoptosis through diverse signaling pathways. While conserved in its core function, IRE1 exhibits species-specific characteristics, particularly in plants versus mammals, leading to different outcomes in ER stress tolerance and cell death. Further research is needed to fully understand its complex regulatory network and in vivo roles.",
    "impact_statement": "This review consolidates current knowledge on IRE1, a critical mediator of cellular response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, highlighting its fundamental role in cell survival and death, with implications for understanding and treating diseases associated with protein misfolding and cellular stress."
