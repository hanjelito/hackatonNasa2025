    "document_title": "Hypergravity disruption of homeorhetic adaptations to lactation in rat dams include changes in circadian clocks",
    "summary_full": "This study investigates how hypergravity (2-g) affects rat dams during pregnancy and lactation, focusing on disruptions to maternal metabolism, hormone levels, behavior, and circadian clocks, which are crucial for successful lactation and pup survival. Exposure to hypergravity from mid-pregnancy through early lactation resulted in reduced body mass in both dams and pups, and significantly increased pup mortality. While labor and delivery were unaffected, hypergravity altered maternal behavior, reduced mammary, liver, and adipose tissue metabolism, and affected key hormone levels (PRL, corticosterone, insulin) and gene expression related to lipid metabolism. Crucially, hypergravity disrupted the expression of core clock genes in mammary and liver tissues and altered circadian rhythms of maternal behavior. The findings suggest that alterations in the dam's circadian system due to hypergravity impair the necessary homeorhetic adaptations for successful lactation, leading to decreased pup survival.",

    "conclusions": "Hypergravity exposure during pregnancy and lactation disrupts essential homeorhetic adaptations required for successful lactation. These disruptions are linked to alterations in maternal metabolism, hormone levels, and, critically, the circadian timing system. The impaired ability of dams to adapt to the demands of lactation under hypergravity leads to reduced milk production and increased pup mortality, highlighting the vital role of gravity in regulating maternal physiology and the circadian system for species survival.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals that altered gravity disrupts maternal adaptations crucial for lactation, impacting offspring survival and highlighting the importance of gravity for circadian regulation of reproductive physiology."
