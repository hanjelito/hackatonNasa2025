    "document_title": "A New Era for Space Life Science: International Standards for Space Omics Processing",
    "summary_full": "As human space exploration expands towards Mars, understanding the biological effects of space stressors like radiation, microgravity, and isolation is critical. \"Omics\" technologies are increasingly used to study these effects, but the precious and complex datasets generated require standardization for optimal scientific return. To address this, the International Standards for Space Omics Processing (ISSOP) consortium has been formed by scientists globally. This paper introduces ISSOP, discusses past lessons learned from space omics experiments using model organisms, and outlines future challenges. Key challenges include limitations in space, time, and finances for experiments; the need for specialized hardware and housing; inconsistencies in sample collection and preservation methods (e.g., slow freezing vs. snap-freezing, use of RNAlater); and the crucial role of comprehensive metadata for data curation and distribution. ISSOP aims to develop and share standardized guidelines for sample processing and metadata normalization to enhance data harmonization, reduce confounding factors, and accelerate scientific discovery in space biology, ultimately supporting safer human space exploration.",
