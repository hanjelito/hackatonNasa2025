    "summary_full": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), is a critical cytoprotective mechanism in plants, similar to yeast and metazoans. This review discusses recent discoveries in plant UPR, highlighting conserved and unique features. In plants, ER-localized stress sensors activate downstream signaling pathways to manage ER stress. Key players include IRE1, which splices specific transcription factor (TF) mRNAs (like AtbZIP60), and membrane-tethered TFs such as AtbZIP28 and AtbZIP17. Unlike metazoans, plants have not yet identified PERK-like proteins, though evidence suggests a similar phosphorylation pathway exists. Plant UPR also involves plant-specific NAC TFs and regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD). Open questions remain regarding the precise triggers for UPR activation and cell fate decisions, the role of IRE1 isoforms, the mechanisms of sensor activation and inactivation, and the involvement of miRNAs and ER shaping proteins. Understanding plant UPR is crucial for improving plant productivity and stress tolerance.",

    "conclusions": "Significant progress has been made in understanding the plant unfolded protein response (UPR), revealing both conserved mechanisms with other eukaryotes and unique plant-specific features. However, many fundamental questions remain unanswered regarding the precise triggers for ER stress responses, the activation and inactivation mechanisms of UPR sensors, and the downstream effectors. Addressing these questions is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of plant ER stress management and holds potential for biotechnological applications aimed at improving plant productivity and stress resilience.",
