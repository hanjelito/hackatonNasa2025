    "document_title": "Approaching Gravity as a Continuum Using the Rat Partial Weight-Bearing Model",
    "summary_full": "This review focuses on the development and utility of a novel rat partial weight-bearing (PWB) model, designed to simulate partial gravity environments relevant to lunar and Martian missions. The model builds upon earlier mouse PWB studies and adapts them for rats, which offer greater physiological similarity to humans and allow for more detailed analyses. The review details the technical adjustments made for housing, suspension apparatus, and the use of a pelvic harness, highlighting the model's improved reliability compared to previous iterations. It discusses the behavioral and physiological responses observed in rats using this model, including transient weight loss and recovery, lack of chronic stress indicators, and dose-dependent deconditioning of the muscular and skeletal systems. Preliminary findings suggest potential cardiovascular protection in partial gravity, though further research is needed. The review also outlines future perspectives, such as investigating gravity shifts lower than 1g, understanding sex-based differences in response to PWB, exploring underlying cellular mechanisms, developing new therapeutic countermeasures, and addressing outstanding questions related to circadian rhythms, radiation, and biomarker identification. The authors conclude that the rat PWB model is a valuable tool for studying the continuum of gravity and its effects on physiology, crucial for ensuring astronaut safety on future deep space missions.",
