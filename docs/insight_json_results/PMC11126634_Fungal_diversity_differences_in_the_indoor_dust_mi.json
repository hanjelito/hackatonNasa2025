    "document_title": "Fungal diversity differences in the indoor dust microbiome from built environments on earth and in space",
    "summary_full": "This study compares the fungal and bacterial communities found in dust collected from Earth-based residential homes and the International Space Station (ISS). It reveals significant differences between the two environments, with Earth-based homes exhibiting higher microbial diversity (465 fungal OTUs, 237 bacterial ASVs) compared to the ISS (102 fungal OTUs, 102 bacterial ASVs). When exposed to elevated moisture conditions, fungal communities in ISS dust changed more rapidly, with Aspergillus dominating, while Earth-based communities remained relatively stable. These findings highlight the impact of unique spaceflight conditions on microbial communities and can inform future spacecraft design to promote healthier indoor environments for astronauts.",

    "conclusions": "Dust from Earth-based residential homes is significantly more diverse in both fungal and bacterial communities compared to dust from the International Space Station. Exposure to elevated moisture conditions leads to changes in fungal community composition, with a more rapid and pronounced shift observed in ISS dust, characterized by the dominance of Aspergillus. These findings underscore the distinct microbial profiles of Earth and space environments and have implications for designing healthier indoor spaces for future space missions.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals critical differences in the dust microbiome between Earth and the ISS, informing strategies for maintaining crew health and spacecraft integrity in future space habitats."
