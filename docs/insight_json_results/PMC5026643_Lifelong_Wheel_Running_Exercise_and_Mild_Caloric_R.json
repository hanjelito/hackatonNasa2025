    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of lifelong mild caloric restriction (CR) and wheel running exercise with CR (WR+CR) on caspase-independent apoptosis and heat shock proteins (HSPs) in aging rat skeletal muscle. The researchers hypothesized that these interventions would reduce age-induced increases in endonuclease G (EndoG) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), while preserving HSP27 and HSP70 levels. They found that while aging increased nuclear EndoG levels, both CR and WR+CR significantly attenuated this increase. HSP27 protein content and phosphorylation were reduced with age but restored by CR and further enhanced by WR+CR. AIF and HSP70 levels were not significantly affected by the interventions. The findings suggest that CR and WR+CR attenuate age-associated apoptosis by preventing nuclear EndoG accumulation, with HSP27 signaling playing a key role in this protective mechanism.",

    "conclusions": "Lifelong mild caloric restriction and wheel running exercise with caloric restriction effectively attenuate age-induced nuclear accumulation of EndoG in skeletal muscle. These interventions also upregulate HSP27 protein levels and phosphorylation, suggesting that HSP27 may act as an upstream protective mechanism against apoptosis and sarcopenia by modulating EndoG signaling.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals that lifelong exercise and caloric restriction can protect aging skeletal muscle from apoptosis by targeting specific molecular pathways, offering potential strategies for combating age-related muscle loss."
