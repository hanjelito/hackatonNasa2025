    "summary_full": "This study investigated the cardiovascular response to immunization in mice during spaceflight aboard the International Space Station (ISS). Mice were immunized with tetanus toxoid and CpG adjuvant (TT + CpG) and their heart transcriptomes were analyzed. Results showed that immunization in space heightened cardiac inflammation via the NF-κB signaling pathway, leading to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IFNγ, IL-17, and IL-6. Additional transcriptomic changes involved the cytoskeleton and oxidative stress protection. The findings indicate that immunization in space can induce cardiac inflammation, providing a basis for future research on cardiac alterations during space travel.",

    "conclusions": "A 30-day spaceflight exposure combined with immunization can induce cardiac inflammation and cytoskeletal remodeling in mice. While protective transcripts are induced to mitigate oxidative stress and prevent cardiomyocyte loss, the activation of inflammatory pathways warrants further investigation for potential long-term cardiovascular health implications for astronauts.",
    "impact_statement": "This study reveals that immunization in space can trigger cardiac inflammation, highlighting a critical consideration for astronaut health during long-duration space missions."
