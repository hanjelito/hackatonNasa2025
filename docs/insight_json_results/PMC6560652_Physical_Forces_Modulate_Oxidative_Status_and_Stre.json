    "summary_full": "This study investigates the effects of physical forces, specifically microgravity and its simulations (rotation and random positioning), on the physiological responses of giant yeast colonies (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Yeast colonies, which exhibit complex stratification and respond to environmental cues like ammonia and shear stress, serve as a model for human cellular processes. The research found that true and simulated microgravity exacerbated cellular redox responses and apoptosis. These changes were largely dependent on shear stress pathways but varied between different simulation models. The study also explored the role of nutrient media (rich YPD vs. poor YE) and stress response promoters (Msn4 and Sfp1) in these responses. The findings suggest that microgravity, by altering convection and ammonia signaling, significantly impacts yeast colony metabolism, stress defense, and cell death pathways, offering insights into drug action, cell aging, and tumor development.",

    "conclusions": "Physical forces, including true microgravity and its simulations, significantly modulate oxidative status, stress defense, and metabolic adaptation in giant yeast colonies. Microgravity exacerbates redox responses and apoptosis, with these changes being shear-response dependent and influenced by media composition and specific stress response promoters. The study highlights that different microgravity simulation techniques (rotation vs. random positioning) yield distinct cellular responses, underscoring the complexity of spaceflight effects. These findings provide a foundation for understanding drug action, cell aging, and colony differentiation in altered gravity environments.",
