    "summary_full": "This paper introduces NemaFlex, a novel microfluidics-based system designed to standardize the measurement of muscle strength in the model organism C. elegans. Traditional methods for assessing muscle strength in C. elegans are hindered by variations in animal behavior and locomotion. NemaFlex overcomes this by measuring the deflection of micropillars as a nematode crawls through a dense array. The system optimizes pillar design and measurement conditions to yield a 'maximum exertable force' (MEF) that is independent of behavior and gait. Validation studies using muscle-contracting agents and genetic mutants confirm NemaFlex's reliability. Furthermore, a scaling factor is provided to correct for animal size, enabling comparative strength studies. NemaFlex is presented as a valuable tool for genetic and drug screens, understanding neuromuscular function, and studying muscle degeneration in aging and disease.",
