    "summary_full": "This study investigates the mechanisms that determine the cellular volume allocated to chloroplasts in Arabidopsis thaliana. The researchers identified a small gene family, named REDUCED CHLOROPLAST COVERAGE (REC), which encodes proteins of unknown function that contribute to establishing the proportion of cellular volume devoted to chloroplasts. Knocking out these genes resulted in a significant reduction (up to 50%) in chloroplast compartment size. The REC1 protein, which plays a major role in this mechanism, is found in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Its localization between these compartments appears to be regulated by signals related to cell expansion or chloroplast function, as demonstrated by its exclusion from the nucleus upon treatment with amitrole. The study also characterized other members of the REC family (REC2, REC3) and the related gene FRIENDLY, finding complex interactions among them that affect chloroplast size, chlorophyll levels, and chloroplast distribution. Overexpression of REC1 led to an increase in chloroplast coverage, supporting its role in regulating chloroplast compartment size. The findings suggest that the REC gene family acts as an extraplastidic mechanism to control chloroplast size, with potential implications for improving crop yields through enhanced photosynthesis.",

    "conclusions": "The REC gene family, including REC1, REC2, and REC3, plays a crucial role in establishing the size of the chloroplast compartment within plant cells. REC1, localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, appears to be a key regulator whose subcellular distribution is modulated by signals related to chloroplast function or cell expansion. These findings provide a foundation for understanding how organelle size is controlled and offer potential avenues for improving photosynthetic efficiency and crop yields.",
