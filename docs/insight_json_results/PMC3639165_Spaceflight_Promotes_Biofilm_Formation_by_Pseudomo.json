    "summary_full": "This study investigated the effects of spaceflight on the biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen. Experiments conducted during two Space Shuttle Atlantis missions (STS-132 and STS-135) revealed that spaceflight significantly increased viable cell numbers, biofilm biomass, and thickness compared to normal gravity controls. Notably, spaceflight induced a unique column-and-canopy biofilm architecture, not observed on Earth. This novel structure was found to be independent of carbon source and phosphate concentrations but essential for flagella-driven motility. The findings suggest that spaceflight alters bacterial community-level behaviors, with implications for microbial challenges and human-microbe interactions in long-term space missions. Increased oxygen availability, facilitated by gas exchange inserts, minimized the gravitational effects on biofilm formation, suggesting that resource availability plays a role in spaceflight-induced changes.",

These findings highlight the profound impact of spaceflight on bacterial community behavior and underscore the importance of understanding these changes for astronaut health and mission success.",
