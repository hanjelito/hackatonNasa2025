    "summary_full": "This perspective proposes the creation of a Human Cell Space Atlas, analogous to the Human Cell Atlas project on Earth, to serve as a global resource for space life science research. As humanity expands into space for multi-year missions, high-resolution omics data collected in orbit could enable precision spaceflight healthcare. The paper discusses the potential of omics technologies to understand and mitigate the health impacts of spaceflight, including drug and micronutrient metabolism, and the need for standardized data collection. It highlights the challenges and opportunities in developing personalized health strategies for astronauts, considering factors like genetic predispositions and environmental exposures. Furthermore, the authors address the significant ethical, cultural, and legal considerations surrounding human space omics research, emphasizing the need for international collaboration and balanced policies to protect astronaut rights while advancing scientific discovery and ensuring mission safety.",
