    "document_title": "MHC Diversity Across Time and Space",
    "summary_full": "This review explores the geographic and temporal patterns of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) diversity in wild populations, focusing on how selective and demographic processes shape these patterns. It discusses MHC diversity along latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, relating it to the Latitude Diversity Gradient and Central Marginal Theories, and notes that diversity is often lower at species distribution edges. The review highlights the threat of reduced immunogenetic diversity to wildlife populations facing climate change and emerging parasites, proposing the integration of immunogenetic, environmental, and parasite data for conservation and coevolutionary studies. It also touches upon the challenges in MHC characterization and suggests future research directions involving multidisciplinary data integration and advanced sequencing technologies.",

    "conclusions": "Understanding the mechanisms that maintain genetic diversity, particularly MHC diversity, is vital for comprehending local adaptation and resistance to infectious diseases. Future research should focus on characterizing complete MHC loci, analyzing allele frequency changes over broad spatial and temporal scales, and integrating multidisciplinary data to disentangle evolutionary forces. Improving accessibility to centralized, multidisciplinary datasets is crucial for advancing knowledge on adaptive genetic variability in wild animals. Conservation efforts should monitor MHC diversity in vulnerable populations to ensure long-term species survival amidst climate change and emerging diseases.",
    "impact_statement": "This review highlights the critical role of MHC genetic diversity in wildlife health and survival, emphasizing its vulnerability to climate change and habitat degradation, and proposes integrated data approaches for conservation and understanding host-parasite coevolution."
