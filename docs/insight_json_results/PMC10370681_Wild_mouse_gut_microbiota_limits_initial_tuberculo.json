    "summary_full": "This study investigated the impact of wild mouse gut microbiota on tuberculosis (TB) immunopathology in BALB/c mice. Mice reconstituted with wild mouse gut microbiota (WildR) showed better control of initial TB infection compared to conventional laboratory mice (LabC), with lower bacterial loads in the lungs during the acute phase. While both groups experienced TB-induced gut dysbiosis, the composition of their gut microbiomes differed significantly prior to and during infection. The wild mouse gut microbiota did not alter the typical lung histopathology of TB in BALB/c mice. Although WildR mice exhibited a less pronounced T cell response in the lungs during acute infection, this difference faded over time. Cytokine profiles in infected organs were largely independent of the gut microbiota. In conclusion, the wild mouse gut microbiota offers some early control of TB infection in BALB/c mice, but this advantage diminishes as the infection progresses to the chronic phase.",

    "conclusions": "The wild mouse gut microbiota provides a degree of early control over initial tuberculosis infection in BALB/c mice, likely through enhanced innate immune responses, but this protective effect diminishes as the infection progresses to a chronic state. The gut microbiota composition differs significantly between conventional and wild-type reconstituted mice, and TB infection induces dysbiosis in both. However, the wild mouse gut microbiota does not alter the typical lung pathology or systemic cytokine profiles associated with TB in this model.",
    "impact_statement": "This study suggests that the gut microbiome composition can influence the early stages of tuberculosis infection, highlighting potential avenues for microbiome-based interventions to improve host resistance."
