    "summary_full": "This document is an erratum correcting a previously published article. The erratum states that the X-axis label was missing from Fig. 4 in the original publication. The corrected Fig. 4, which displays microbial gene pathways observed in whole metagenomes of International Space Station (ISS) and Space Analog Facility (SAF) samples, is provided. The figure shows the assignment of reads to KEGG orthologies based on gene function categories, with read abundance represented on a square-root scale and absolute read counts indicated.",
