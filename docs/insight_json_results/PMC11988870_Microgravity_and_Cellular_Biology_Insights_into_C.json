    "summary_full": "This review synthesizes current research on the effects of microgravity on biological systems, focusing on cellular responses and their implications for human health. Microgravity significantly impacts the immune system, impairing T cell activation and cytokine production, and affecting macrophage differentiation, leading to increased infection susceptibility. In cancer biology, it promotes spheroid formation in cancer stem cells and thyroid cancer cells, mimicking tumor dynamics and offering insights for oncology. Microgravity also enhances tissue regeneration by modulating pathways like Hippo and PI3K-Akt, improving stem cell differentiation into hematopoietic and cardiomyocyte lineages. At the organ level, it alters hepatic metabolism, endothelial function, and bone mechanotransduction, contributing to lipid dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and bone loss. Notably, human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes cultured under microgravity show enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, calcium handling, and structural maturation, presenting therapeutic opportunities for cardiac diseases. These findings highlight microgravity's dual role in space medicine and terrestrial health, driving advances in regenerative therapies, oncology, and immunology.",
