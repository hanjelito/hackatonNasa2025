    "summary_full": "This paper reports the draft genome sequence of Solibacillus kalamii ISSFR-015, a novel bacterial species isolated from a high-energy particulate arrestance (HEPA) filter on the International Space Station (ISS). The bacterium was isolated from a filter that had been in service for 40 months. The draft genome sequence has a total size of 3,809,180 bp with a G+C content of 38.61%, and it contains 3,814 genes, including those potentially involved in resistance to oxidative stress, vancomycin, copper, hydrogen peroxide, and arsenic. These genes suggest mechanisms for survival in the high-stress environment of the ISS and during spacecraft cleaning procedures. The genome was sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform and assembled into 28 contigs.",
