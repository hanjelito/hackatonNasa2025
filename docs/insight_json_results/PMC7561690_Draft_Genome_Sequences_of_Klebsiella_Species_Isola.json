    "document_title": "Draft Genome Sequences of Klebsiella Species Isolated from the International Space Station",
    "summary_full": "Ten bacterial strains, identified as Klebsiella species (K. aerogenes, K. pneumoniae, and K. quasipneumoniae), were isolated from various locations on the International Space Station (ISS). Whole-genome sequencing was performed on these strains to facilitate comparative genomic studies with Earth-based counterparts. This research aims to understand the adaptation mechanisms of Klebsiella species to space conditions, which could potentially impact astronaut health due to their known virulence and antibiotic resistance. The genome sequences have been deposited in GenBank and NASA GeneLab for public access.",
