    "summary_full": "This study investigates the transcriptomic response of Caenorhabditis elegans to simulated microgravity and its sustained effects after returning to ground conditions. The researchers found that approximately 75% of gene expression changes induced by simulated microgravity persisted for four days after returning to ground, with most reverting by twelve days. Integrative RNA-seq and mass spectrometry analyses suggest that simulated microgravity impacts longevity-regulating insulin/IGF-1 and sphingolipid signaling pathways. Notably, 118 genes were found to be commonly differentially expressed in both simulated microgravity and space-exposed worms, providing insights into microgravity's effects on biological systems during and after exposure.",

    "conclusions": "Simulated microgravity induces significant and partially sustained transcriptomic changes in C. elegans, affecting key pathways related to longevity and metabolism. The study identified a core set of microgravity-responsive genes conserved between simulated and actual spaceflight conditions, with potential implications for human health in space. The findings highlight the downregulation of the sphingolipid signaling pathway as a key response to microgravity, potentially contributing to lifespan extension.",
