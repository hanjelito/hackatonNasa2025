    "document_title": "Draft Genome Sequences of Aspergillus and Penicillium Species Isolated from the International Space Station and Crew Resupply Vehicle Capsule",
    "summary_full": "This study reports the draft whole-genome sequences (WGS) of 30 fungal strains belonging to the Aspergillus and Penicillium genera, isolated from the International Space Station (ISS) and a crew resupply vehicle (CRV). The WGS were generated using Illumina sequencing and assembled with SPAdes. Species identification was performed using ITS, calmodulin, and Î²-tubulin sequences. The generated WGS will enable detailed genomic characterization, facilitating the exploration of potential applications in space and biotechnological industries. The study also highlights the importance of these fungi as models for investigating the effects of microgravity and irradiation on adaptation and evolution.",
