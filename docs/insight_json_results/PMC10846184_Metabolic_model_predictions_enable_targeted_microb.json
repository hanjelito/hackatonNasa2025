    "summary_full": "This study introduces the concept of 'precision prebiotics' to selectively modulate the abundance of specific beneficial microbes within a microbiome. The researchers used metabolic modeling to identify compounds that could preferentially increase the growth of the immune-protective bacterium Pseudomonas lurida MYb11 over Ochrobactrum vermis MYb71 in a two-member Caenorhabditis elegans microbiome. They found that unique uptake compounds are rare in microbial communities, necessitating the identification of prebiotics with overlapping metabolic niches. Using constraint-based modeling, they predicted several potential precision prebiotics, and experimentally validated four: L-serine, L-threonine, D-mannitol, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which specifically increased MYb11 abundance in vitro. Further in vivo experiments in C. elegans confirmed that L-serine could selectively boost MYb11 levels within the host. The findings demonstrate the utility of metabolic modeling for designing targeted microbiome interventions.",
