    "summary_full": "This paper introduces the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA), a comprehensive data and sample repository for spaceflight research, significantly increasing publicly available human space omics data. SOMA integrates clinical, cellular, and multi-omic profiles from various missions, including the NASA Twins Study, JAXA CFE study, and the SpaceX Inspiration4 crew. The resource includes genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiome datasets. Key findings reveal consistent molecular shifts across missions, such as cytokine changes and telomere elongation, alongside mission-specific responses. The study also links these human data to orthologous mouse datasets. SOMA aims to accelerate precision aerospace medicine by providing data and tools for health monitoring, risk mitigation, and countermeasure development for future lunar and Mars missions.",

    "conclusions": "The Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA) provides a comprehensive resource for understanding the molecular and physiological impacts of spaceflight. Short-duration spaceflight induces significant molecular changes, some mirroring those seen in longer missions, including cytokine shifts, telomere elongation, and gene expression alterations. While most markers return to baseline post-flight, some persist, indicating a dynamic re-adaptation process. The study highlights the utility of single-cell multi-omics and cfRNA profiling for detailed analysis of spaceflight effects and emphasizes the need for continued data collection and biobanking to support future long-duration missions and the development of precision aerospace medicine.",
    "impact_statement": "This work establishes a foundational, publicly accessible multi-omic atlas of human spaceflight, significantly advancing our understanding of space-induced physiological changes and paving the way for improved astronaut health monitoring and countermeasures for deep space exploration."
